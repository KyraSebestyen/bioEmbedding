rose;Rosa;organism;PG10005;52;he told us that the roses of this field, which is called gulgal, were deemed sacred, and were not allowed to be gathered without the special permission of the priests, under a heavy penalty, and that he was one of those whose duty it was to prevent the violation of the law, and to bring the offenders to punishment.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10005;52;the brahmin, having diverted himself a while with my surprise and disappointment, then informed me, that the rose had ever been regarded in morosofia, as the symbol of female purity, delicacy, and sweetness, which notion had grown into a popular superstition, that whenever a marriage is consummated on the earth, one of these flowers springs up in the moon, and that in colour, shape, size, or other property, it is a fit type of the individual whose change of state is thus commemorated.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10005;52;"i know not," said he, "but i have heard it thus explained,--that the roses generally spring up, as well as blow, in the course of their long nights, during which the earth's resplendent disc is the most conspicuous object in the heavens, which two facts stand, in the opinion of the multitude, in the relation of cause and effect.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10005;52;i would here remark, that as the rose is called gul in the persian language and the ancient sanscrit, the name of this field furnished another argument in support of the brahmin's hypothesis of the origin of the moon.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10005;52;while thus oblivious of the past, and reckless of the future, we were enjoying the present moment in this badinage , and i was extolling the odour of the rose, as beyond every other grateful to the olfactory nerves of man, a lively, flippant little personage came up, and accosted the brahmin with the familiarity of an acquaintance.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10005;53;but the chief part of the gratification you receive from smelling a rose, arises from some past scene of delight of which it reminds you, as, of the days of your innocence and childhood, when you ran about the garden--or when you were decorated with nosegays--or danced round a may-pole,,this is rather a free translation,--or presented a bunch of flowers to some little favourite."

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1;then he received a letter from edith, speaking with deference and solicitude of bruce's rheumatism, entreating him to do the cure thoroughly, and suggesting that they should call the little girl matilda, after a rich and sainted--though still living--aunt of edith's.

rosebud;Cercis;organism;PG10021;1;it appeared from the detailed description that the new daughter had, as a matter of course,and at two days old,, long golden hair, far below her waist, sweeping lashes and pencilled brows, a rosebud mouth, an intellectual forehead, chiselled features and a tall, elegant figure.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1;overwhelmed with joy at the advent of such a paragon, and horrified at edith's choice of a name, bruce had replied at once by wire, impulsively,'certainly not matilda i would rather she were called aspasia.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1;edith read this expression of feeling on a colourless telegraph form, and as she was, at knightsbridge, unable to hear the ironical tone of the message she took it literally.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;1;sometimes edith thought that her daughter's names were decidedly a failure--aspasia by mistake, matilda through obstinacy, and dilly by accident.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;2;one afternoon edith was talking to the telephone in a voice of agonised entreaty that would have melted the hardest of hearts, but did not seem to have much effect on the exchange, which, evidently, was not responsive to pathos that day.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3;edith agreed that she knew of no really suitable place where she could buy a new evening dress at eight-thirty on sunday evening.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3;'you are perfectly right,' said edith,'the bankruptcy of an old friend and colleague could be no satisfaction to any man.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;3;bruce, in trying to ring the bell, unfortunately turned out all the electric light in the house, and was standing alone in despair in the dark when, fortunately the porter, who had been out to post a letter, ran back, and turned up the light again....

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;edith suggested doubtfully.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;an idea occurred to edith, and she asked for a directory.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;'i think we'd better tell them what has happened,' said edith, 'it will make them laugh.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;'now, now, don't be bitter, edith dear--never be bitter--life has its ups and downs....

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;'i'm sure you are,' said edith, 'it could be no possible satisfaction to you to know that a friend and colleague of yours is either distressingly hard up or painfully penurious.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;'i could tell you what you are,' said edith, 'but i won't, because now you must take me to the carlton.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;edith found it difficult to see the point.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;this, edith said, would have been excellent, provided that the parlourmaid hadn't told them that she and bruce had arrived about a quarter to ten on sunday evening and asked if the mitchells had begun dinner.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;4;bruce was in good spirits again, he was pleased too, because he was going to the theatre that evening with edith and vincy, to see a play that he thought wouldn't be very good.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;5;he was very devoted to both edith and bruce, and he was a confidant of both.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;5;he sometimes said to edith that he felt he was just what was wanted in the little home, an intimate stranger coming in occasionally with a fresh atmosphere was often of great value,as, for instance, now,in calming or averting storms.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;6;he delighted in bruce, but had with edith, of course, more mutual understanding and intellectual sympathy, and though they met constantly, his friendship with her had never been misunderstood.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;10;almost immediately on her arrival edith noticed a tall, clean-shaven man, with smooth fair hair, observant blue eyes, and a rather humorous expression, and she instantly decided that she would try to will him to take her to dinner.,rather a superfluous effort of magnetism, since it must have been settled already by fate and the ribbons.,it was obvious from one quick glance that he shared the wish.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;10;edith felt happy tonight, her spirits were raised by what she felt to be an atmosphere tičde , as the french say, full of indulgence, sympathetic, relaxing, in which either cleverness or stupidity could float equally at its ease.

carnation;Dianthus caryophyllus;organism;PG10021;10;she was unable to help referring constantly to the hit she made in peril at manchester in 1887, nor could she ever resist speaking of the young man who sent her red carnations every day of his blighted existence for fifteen years, a pure romance, indeed, for, as she owned, he never even wished to be introduced to her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12;though only by the merest, slightest movement of an eyelash edith could not avoid showing her surprise.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12;edith felt sure of it.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12;said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12;'but it doesn't always follow that a thing has happened because you do talk about it,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;12;mrs mitchell gladly told edith all about aylmer ross, how clever he was, how nice, how devoted to his little boy.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13;'no doubt,' said edith, wishing the first wife had remained alive.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;13;mrs mitchell had taken an immense fancy to edith and showed it by telling her all about a wonderful little tailor who made coats and skirts better than lucile for next to nothing, and by introducing to her lord rye and the embassy man, and mr cricker.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13;edith was unreasonably annoyed.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13;just before the party practically broke up, edith had an opportunity of saying as she passed aylmer,'i thought we were going to have a talk instead of playing games?'

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;13;mr cricker, who had firmly refused the whole evening, in spite of abject entreaties, to dance like nijinsky, suddenly relented when everyone had forgotten all about it, and was leaping alone in the studio, while lord rye, always a great lingerer, was playing richard strauss to himself on the baby grand, and smoking a huge cigar.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;13;'edith,' said bruce solemnly, as they drove away, 'i've made a friend tonight.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;14;'i wish you wouldn't oppose me, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;14;mentally rearranging her evening dress, edith drove home thoughtfully.

hyacinth;Hyacinthus;organism;PG10021;14;it was a warm day, and though there was a fire the windows were open, letting in the scent of the mauve and pink hyacinths in the little window-boxes.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;15;but edith went back to the piano at once, and went on trying over the song that she didn't know, without making any excuse for the faltering notes.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;15;'i don't like to have many things in a room,' said edith, holding out her delicate hands to the fire.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;15;he amuses me,' edith replied softly.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;15;'no, i don't think you would at all,' said edith, looking him straight in the face.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;15;'i shall certainly go,' said edith, 'whether he asks me or not.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;16;said edith, as she glanced at the window.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;16;'edith!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;16;'there hasn't been time yet for many more, has there, edith dear?

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10021;17;he was the sort of man who is adored by children, animals, servants and women.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;18;the truth was--it sounds romantic, but is really scientific, all romance being, perhaps, based on science--that edith's appearance corresponded in every particular with an ideal that had grown up with him.

fisher;Martes pennanti;organism;PG10021;18;had she been a fool, or a bore, a silly little idiot or a fisher of men, a social sham who prattled of duchesses or a strenuous feminine politician who babbled of votes, a christian scientist bent on converting, an adventuress without adventures,the worst kind,, a mind-healer or a body-snatcher, a hockey-player or even a lady novelist, it would have been exactly the same, whatever she had been, mentally or morally, he would undoubtedly have fallen in love with her physically, at first sight.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;19;he knew that if edith had been free his one thought would have been to marry her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;20;chapter ix aylmer at the carlton aylmer had easily persuaded bruce and edith to dine with him next day, although they were engaged to the elder mrs ottley already.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;such second-rate solicitudes would never even occur to edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;edith asked.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;'my dear edith, you can safely leave that to me.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;perhaps to you, edith, it seems a rather old-fashioned idea, and i daresay you think it's rot, but to me there's something very sacred about the idea of a mother.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;'circumstances alter cases, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;it really seems to me you're getting absurdly exacting and touchy, edith dear.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;edith looked away.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;edith sat down to the writing-table.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;'right as usual, very thoughtful of you, you're a clever little woman sometimes, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;21;'my dear edith,' said bruce, 'you're over-anxious, i shall do nothing of the kind.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;22;as soon as bruce had gone out edith rang up the elder mrs ottley on the telephone, and relieved her anxiety in advance.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;22;edith was interested and pleased to go to the house of her new friend and to reconstruct the scene as it must have been when mrs aylmer ross had been there.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;22;the boy was good-looking, but not, edith thought, as handsome as aylmer.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;22;lady everard told edith that she felt quite like a sort of mother to aylmer.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24;he had never shown by word or manner any more of his sentiment than on the second occasion when they had met but edith was growing thoroughly accustomed to this new interest, and it certainly gave a zest to her existence, for she knew, as women do know, or at any rate she believed, that she had an attraction for him, which he didn't intend to give away.

green marble;Euchloe (Euchloe) naina;organism;PG10021;24;they went into the little dining-room, which was curiously furnished with a green marble dining-table, narrow, as in the pictures of the last supper, at which the guests could sit on one side only to be waited on from the other.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24;edith exclaimed.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24;don't worry about me, edith.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;24;chapter x shopping chez soi edith was expecting aylmer to call that afternoon before he went away.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;this was his secret romance with a certain girl artist of whom he never spoke, although edith knew that some day he would tell her about that also.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;edith had, however, felt until now merely the agreeable excitement of knowing that a man she liked, and in whom she was immensely interested, was growing apparently devoted to her, while she had always believed that she would know how to deal with the case in such a way that it could never lead to anything more--that is to say, to more than she wished.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;edith was remarkably feminine in every attribute, in manner, in movement and in appearance, indeed, for a woman of the present day unusually and refreshingly feminine.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;edith was very clever, indeed, most ingenious, in managing practical affairs, as long as she was the director, the general of the campaign.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;but edith did not rattle her housekeeping keys, or count the coals, nor did she even go through accounts, or into the kitchen every day.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;in order to do this edith had to practise a little fraud on bruce, a justifiable and quite unselfish one.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;she gave the cook and housekeeper a quarter of her dress allowance, in addition to the wages bruce considered sufficient, because bruce believed that they could not afford more than a certain amount for a cook, while he admitted that edith, who had a few hundred pounds a year of her own, might need to spend this on dress.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;very little of it went on dress, although edith was not very economical.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;but edith was twenty-eight, and looked younger, so she could dress simply.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;this morning edith had telephoned to her friend, miss bennett, an old schoolfellow who had nothing to do, and adored commissions.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;edith, sitting by the fire or at the 'phone, gave her orders, which were always decisive, short and yet meticulous.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;miss bennett was a little late this morning, and edith had been getting quite anxious to see her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;25;when she at last arrived--she was a nondescript-looking girl, with a small hat squashed on her head, a serge coat and skirt, black gloves and shoes with spats--edith greeted her rather reproachfully with,'you're late, grace.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;she was devoted to edith, and to a few other friends of both sexes, of whom she made idols.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;'sorry, but i had to do a lot of--' 'all right,' interrupted edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;edith spoke in her low, soft, impressive voice, rather slowly.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;not much,' added edith, 'at the most.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;'edith, what curious ideas you have!

orchid;Orchidaceae;organism;PG10021;26;oh, and in case i choose a light-coloured gown, get me just one very large black velvet orchid, too.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;edith looked at her shoes, they were perfect, tiny, pointed and made of black sučde.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;'no,' said edith, who was always frank when it was possible.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;they both laughed, and edith gently pushed her friend out of the room.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;26;when archie and dilly were out, and edith, who always got up rather early, was alone, she often passed her morning hours in reading, dreaming, playing the piano, or even in thinking.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27;edith opened the boxes, cutting the string with scissors.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27;'that's the one,' said edith, taking out one of a deep blue colour, like an italian sky on a coloured picture post-card.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27;taking off her coat edith slipped the gown over her dress, and went to her room,followed closely by miss bennett,to see herself in the long mirror.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27;said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;27;with a quiet smile, edith dismissed her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;28;edith felt less mistress of the situation than she had expected.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;28;overpowered by a sudden impulse, aylmer seized her impetuously by the shoulders, kissed her roughly and at random before she could stop him, and said incoherently,'edith!

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29;i love you, edith,' and then stood up by the mantelpiece.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29;chapter xii 'the moonshine girl' the next evening bruce and edith were going to the society theatre with aylmer.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29;it was their last meeting before he was to go away, edith half expected that he would put it off, but there was no change made in the plans, and they met in the box as arranged.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29;at dinner before the play edith was very bright, and particularly pretty.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;29;and then, where's the sense, edith, in a chap leaving london where he's been the whole of the awful winter, just as it begins to be pleasant here?

cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;29;i can see the charm of the quaint old ideas about black cats and so forth, but i don't for one moment attach any importance to them, nor to the number thirteen, nor any of that sort of bosh.

cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;29;'and oddly enough--as i was trying to tell you just now, only you didn't seem to be listening--a black cat ran across my path only this afternoon.'

cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;29;when i say i nearly ran over it, i mean that a black cat on the same side of the taxi,if you must have details,ran away as the taxi drove on....

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30;'you're pleased to be facetious,' remarked edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30;edith got up.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30;'i'd show it soon enough if i felt it--if i thought i'd any cause,' said edith, 'but i didn't think i had.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30;i think i'm rather glad you're not musical, edith, it takes a woman away from her husband.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30;i thought i was,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30;no, edith dear, i should tell you, if you would only listen to me, to keep up your music, but you won't and there's an end of it...that souffle was really very good.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;30;'oh yes, she's not bad,' said edith.

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10021;30;the scene consisted of model cottages, a chorus of pretty girls in striped cotton were singing.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31;edith smiled and nodded assent, trying to stop the incessant trickle of lady everard's leaking conversation.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31;edith and aylmer looked round the house.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31;'it looks like a jury,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;31;'you're an angel if you've forgiven me,' he said, as they went out.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;32;no, edith, i can't stand it.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;32;you don't know how cruel you are with your sweetness, edith...oh, put yourself in my place!

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;32;'i want to speak to you now, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33;'don't you believe it, edith!

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33;well, let me tell you, if you care to know, that it's love , and nothing else, edith....now, is there anything in the world i can do for you while i'm away?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33;edith was thrilled by the passionate emotion she felt near her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33;let me look at you once more....oh, edith!

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33;edith took away her hand.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33;he thought edith had more colour than usual.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;33;edith, for whom it was a dreary anti-climax, was rather silent.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34;edith said.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34;don't you wish we were both going, edith?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34;edith and bruce, from different directions, arrived at the same moment at their door, and went up together in the lift.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34;on the little hall-table was a letter addressed to edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34;'that a letter, edith?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;34;'what could i have supposed it was, edith?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35;'edith, why don't you take off your hat?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35;edith got up and went towards the door.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35;'edith, i'm pained and surprised at your conduct!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35;edith quickly looked at the letter.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;35;'the question,' said edith, in the most cool, high, irritating voice she could command, 'really, of votes for women hardly enters into our argument here.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36;'edith,' he said rather pathetically, trying to control himself.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36;edith was quite impressed at this flash of prophetic insight.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36;oh, edith, you're looking awfully pretty, i like that hat.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36;never in his life had he been opposed by edith before in this way.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36;he pushed the letter under the door of her room, and said through the keyhole,'edith, look here, i'm just going for a little walk.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;36;the next morning, when a long letter came from aylmer, from spain, edith read it at breakfast and bruce didn't ask a single question.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;37;he was not devoted to her in the way that he was to edith, for whom he had the wholehearted enthusiasm of a loyal friend, and the idolising worship of a fanatic admirer.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;40;he walked a little way, then got into a taxi and drove to see edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;40;when he was in this peculiar condition of mind--the odd mixture of self-reproach, satisfaction, amusement and boredom that he felt now --he always went to see edith, throwing himself into the little affairs of her life as if he had nothing else on his mind.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;40;he was a little anxious about edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;40;her success with their friends delighted mrs mitchell, who was not capable of commonplace feminine jealousy, and who regarded edith as a find of her own.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;40;mrs mitchell assured edith that his bath-chair race with a few choice spirits was still talked of at st leonard's,bath-chairmen, of course, are put in the chairs, and you pull them along,.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;41;edith watched, intensely amused, as she saw that there were really one or two people present who, never having seen mitchell before, naturally did not recognise him now, so that the disguise was considered a triumph.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;41;said mrs mitchell to edith, as she watched her husband proudly.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;41;'yes, i wish he were,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;41;'in armenia, i fancy,' said edith.

turkey;Meleagridinae;organism;PG10021;41;by special permission, as it was so intime , the turkey trot was allowed.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;41;'edith,' said vincy, 'i think you're quieter than you used to be.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;42;'i had a few lines yesterday,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;42;edith smiled and looked pleased.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;42;and how delightfully rare that is, edith dear.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;42;but i have very much the same feeling,' edith said.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;42;when he went out his heart began to sink a little already, but he fought it off, there would be a glimpse of an english face flashing past in a carriage--he thought of edith, but he put it aside.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;44;what was edith doing now?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;44;edith.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;45;chapter xviii a contretemps edith did not know, herself, what had induced her to write that letter to paris.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;45;edith had a high opinion of her own strength of will.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;45;with edith's intellect and temperament they could only fill a part.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;45;perhaps till edith met aylmer she had not quite realised what such real comradeship might mean, coupled with another feeling--not the intellectual sympathy she had for vincy, but something quite different.

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10021;46;she wore a thin light grey cotton dress, and a small grey hat, her hair looked rich, red, and fluffy as ever, her face white and rather thin.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;46;as they were driving along oxford street edith, walking with archie, saw them clearly.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;46;edith knew the girl by sight, knew perfectly well that she was vincy's friend--there was a photograph of her at his rooms.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;46;and he was making love obviously to that sickening, irritating red-haired fool,so edith thought of her,, vincy's silly, affected art-student.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;46;when edith went home she had a bad quarter of an hour.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;46;'edith ottley.'

emu;Dromaius novaehollandiae novaehollandiae;organism;PG10021;47;he felt a little emu....

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10021;47;there was the writing-table, there the bookcase, the few chairs, the grey walls, some pale roses fading in a pewter vase....

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;after edith had written and sent her letter to aylmer in the morning, mrs ottley the elder came to fetch the children to dine, and edith told miss townsend to go for the afternoon.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;edith was fond of her, and, by implication only, occasionally confided in her on other subjects than the children.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;today, however, edith answered that she was very well indeed , but was going to see about things before they went away.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;miss townsend said she would do whatever edith liked.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;this was a relief, for just at this moment edith felt as if even the children would be a burden.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;she was dressed rather like herself, edith observed, she imitated edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;she was slim and had a pretty figure, but was entirely without edith's charm or beauty.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;vaguely edith wondered if she would ever have a love affair, ever marry.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;47;it was a glorious day, very hot, edith felt peculiar.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;48;edith was not interested in herself, and seldom thought much of her own feelings, but she hated self-deception, and now she faced facts.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;48;edith belonged to the superior class of human being whom jealousy chills and cures, and does not stimulate to further efforts.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;48;he had been in love when they married, but edith shrewdly suspected he was not capable of very much more than a weak rather fatuous sentiment for any woman.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;he was laughing as he talked to the miserable creature,so edith called her in her own mind,.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;then edith had a reaction.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;some way off was a girl, with her back to edith, walking with a man.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;her figure was like miss townsend's, and she wore a dress like the one copied from edith's.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;edith walked more quickly, it was the retired part of the gardens on the way towards the bayswater road.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;edith was surprised, was interested, and walked on a few steps.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;there was something familiar in his figure and clothes, and edith saw his face.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;edith turned round and went home.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;and now edith read aylmer's note--it was so real, so sincere, she began to disbelieve her eyes this morning.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;'how are you, edith, old girl?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;'dinner's ready,' announced edith, and they dined.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;towards the end of dinner he was about to make the suggestion again, when edith said in clear, calm but decided tones,'bruce, i am not going to take miss townsend away with us.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;49;'bruce,' answered edith, 'i prefer not to go into the question, and later you will be glad i did not.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50;'oh, all right, edith dear, after all--hang it all--you're the children's mother--it's for you to settle....

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50;after ten minutes he came in and said,'look here, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50;'edith, old girl, i think i'll go round to the club for an hour or two.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50;'whatever you do, edith, will be--what i mean to say is that--well, good night, i sha'n't be long.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50;edith was really delighted, she felt she had won, and she did want that horrid little townsend to be scored off!

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50;you're prettier than ever, edith, sweeter than ever.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;50;i was struck dumb, and rooted to the spot, and knocked all of a heap, in a manner of speaking, as vincy would say,' edith went on, laughing.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;51;he's never told me actually, but i've felt it,' edith said.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;51;'i hope he won't, unless he really wants to,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;51;do you care for me a little bit, edith?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;51;'she won't come back any more,' answered edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52;'remember, there are to be no more exceptions,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52;and as she had been treated absolutely as a confidante by edith, the girl had certainly shown herself treacherous, and rather too clearly capable of dissimulation.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52;edith thought this must have a bad effect on the children.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52;edith was essentially a very feminine woman though she had a mental attitude rightly held to be more characteristic of men.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52;miss townsend knew perfectly well what the children were to edith, and, for all she knew, there was no-one in edith's life except bruce, so that it was rather cruel.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52;edith intended to keep up her dignity so absolutely that miss townsend could never see her again, that she could never speak to edith on the subject.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52;on the other hand, after the first shock and disgust at seeing him, edith's anger with bruce himself had entirely passed.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;52;he was just as good a sort now as he had ever been, and as she was not blinded by the resentment and fury of the real jealousy of passion, edith saw clearly, and knew that bruce cared far more for her than for anybody else, that in so far as he could love anybody he loved her in his way.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53;'edith!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53;'oh yes,' said edith.

brick;Thunbergia mysorensis;organism;PG10021;53;'edith, you're a brick.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53;'edith, you're a brick.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53;'i know it's a very odd thing to ask,' continued edith, 'just a fancy, why should i mind your not seeing miss townsend?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53;edith thought one might be unfaithful without being disloyal, and she believed bruce now.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53;'then you're not cross, edith--not depressed?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53;'edith!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;53;'don't you forgive me, edith, for anything i've done that you don't like?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;54;edith was really the only woman for whom his weak and flickering passion had lingered at all long, and in addition to that,the first glamour of which had faded,she had a real hold over him.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;54;he was not incapable, either, of appreciating edith's attitude.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;54;edith was wonderful!

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;54;edith was the only woman for whom even a little affection could last, and he would have long tired of her but for her exceptional character and the extraordinary trouble and tact she used with him.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55;with the curious blindness common to all married people,and indeed to any people who live together,, clever edith had been entirely taken in, in a certain sense, she had always felt,until the 'townsend case',half disdainfully but satisfactorily certain of bruce's fidelity.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55;edith always felt that she must go to the very extreme of loyalty to anyone who was faithful to her, she valued fidelity so deeply, and now this feeling was naturally relaxed a little.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55;he thought edith very attractive, and would have liked to have the duty of consoling her.

hazel;Corylus;organism;PG10021;55;i should call them hazel, with black lashes, no, not exactly black--brown.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55;edith was devoting herself to the children, bruce had less of her society than usual.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;55;one day he told edith that he had just had a rather serious quarrel with someone who was awfully cross, and carried on like anything and wouldn't give over.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;56;oh, but, edith, it's hard to hurt anyone.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;56;'edith,' he said,' have you asked aylmer to come and stay with us at westgate?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;56;you're inconsistent, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;57;i'll tell edith you'll write for rooms.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;57;edith was there.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;57;and edith, dear edith--she, too, must be frightfully keen on him, when one came to think about it, to forgive him so readily about margaret tow--oh, confound miss townsend.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10021;58;as soon as a visitor came in, she rose from the suspiciously clean writing-table, put down the dry pen on a spotless blotter, went and sat in a large brocaded arm-chair in front of some palms, within view of the piano, and began to talk.

cat;Felis;organism;PG10021;58;there were other attempts at the classical in the decoration of the room, but lady everard herself had reduced this idea to bathos by huge quantities of signed photographs in silver frames, by large waste-paper baskets, lined with blue satin and trimmed with pink rosettes, by fans which were pockets, stuffed cats which were paperweights, oranges which were pincushions, and other debris from those charitable and social bazaars of which she was a constant patroness.

banjo;Aspredo aspredo;organism;PG10021;58;it isn't good form, it really isn't, to see a man of his age, with his face blacked, coming in after dinner with a banjo, calling himself the musical white-eyed kaffir, as he did the last time i was there.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;58;lord rye likes it, i think, but he says mr mitchell's mad--that's what it is, a little mad.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;58;last time lord rye was there everybody had a present given them hidden in their table napkins.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10021;58;there had been some mistake in the parcels, i believe, and miss mooney--you know, the actress, myra mooney--received a safety razor, and lord rye a vanity bag.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10021;60;however, have a little more tea, or some iced coffee, it's so much more refreshing i always think.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;61;he continued in this strain for some time, constantly going back to his admiration for edith, and then began,with a good deal of bitterness,on the subject of another young singer, whom he declared to be un garcon charmant , but no good.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;62;he saw edith as much as ever, and far less formally than before.

flicker;Colaptes;organism;PG10021;62;london was getting stale and tired, and the last feverish flickers of the exhausted season alternated with a kind of languor in which nobody bothered much about anybody else's affairs.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;62;edith was curiously peaceful and contented.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;62;'miss townsend was very kind to you,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;62;'very kind of her, i'm sure,' laughed edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63;edith asked, without much interest.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63;'no, you mean, 'one of us',' corrected edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63;'it looks lovely,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63;here edith showed more interest.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63;edith introduced them.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10021;63;i'll tell you what you ought to have--a great cricket match when the shopping season's over, between the old selfridgians, and the old harrodians,' he said, laughing.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63;'i can't imagine anyone but royalty enjoying these pictures,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;63;edith and bruce were to take up their abode in their little country house at westgate next day.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;64;bruce had been to town so often lately, his manner was so vague, he seemed at once so happy and so preoccupied, so excited, so pleased, so worried, and yet so unnaturally good-tempered, that edith had begun to suspect he was seeing miss townsend again.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;64;'are you getting suspicious of me, edith?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;65;'now go, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;65;'i say--' edith.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;65;privately, edith thought him irresistible in country clothes.,edith had everything here to make her happy, including bruce's mother, who relieved her of the children when she wanted rest and in whose eyes she was perfection.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;66;'never mind what you are, do go and sit down, and take those things off,' said edith.

mandrill;Mandrillus sphinx;organism;PG10021;66;following him, he handed the tea to mr cricker, saying pathetically,'i'm a blue-faced mandrill, and she knew it.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67;chapter xxvii the elopement the following tuesday, edith, aylmer, vincy and mrs ottley were sitting on the veranda after dinner.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67;she looked up to him, in a kind of admiring maternal way, edith often wondered, did she not see aylmer's devotion?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67;'isn't bruce coming down tonight?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67;she asked edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67;edith went into the drawing-room to read it, there was not sufficient light on the veranda....

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67;in growing amazement she read the following words,-- dear edith, 'i hope what i am about to tell you will not worry you too much.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;67;mind you do this, edith, for it is really my duty to give my name to mavis, who, as i have said, is devoted to me heart and soul, and cannot live without me.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68;controlling herself, edith went to the veranda and said to mrs ottley that bruce wasn't coming back for a day or two, that she had neuralgia and was going to retire, but begged aylmer not to go yet.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68;the next morning aylmer at his hotel received a little note asking him to come round and see edith, while the others were out.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68;it was there, in the cool, shady room, that edith showed him the letter.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68;edith, don't you see he wants you to make him free?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68;edith knew she was going to have a hard task now.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68;the children--' 'edith!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68;'edith, you don't care for me.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;68;but, of course, if, later--i mean if he persists--' 'oh, edith, don't be a fool!

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;69;said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;69;'edith, you're beyond me,' said aylmer.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;69;you have no pride, edith.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;69;'forgive me, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70;chapter xxviii bruce returns 'never, edith!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70;the little group at westgate didn't seem to have much been affected by it, and this was the less surprising as aylmer and edith had kept it to themselves.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70;mrs ottley listened imperturbably to edith's story, a somewhat incoherent concoction, but told with dash and decision, that bruce had been ordered away for a sea-voyage for fear of a nervous breakdown.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70;she cried a little, said nothing, kissed edith more than usual, and took the children away for longer walks and drives.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70;her confidence in edith reached the point of superstition, she would never ask her questions.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;70;edith had assured her that bruce would come back all right, and that was enough.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;probably there was at the back of his attentions to mrs ottley a vague idea that he wanted to get her on his side--that she might be a useful ally, but he was always charming to elderly women, and inclined to be brusque with younger ones, excepting edith, he remembered his own mother with so great a cult of devotion, and his late wife with such a depressed indifference.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;edith had asked aylmer to try and forget what had happened--to make himself believe that bruce had really only gone away medicinally.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;one day vincy, alone on the beach with edith, remarked that he wondered what had happened to mavis.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;edith told him that she had run away with a married man.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;'never, edith!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;'but you're not serious, edith?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;gormed, edith dear, is really the only word.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;'i'm not jealous,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;'well--oh, you know--' 'edith, i'm awfully sorry, i wish i'd married her now, then she wouldn't have bothered about bruce.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;'i know, edith dear, but i'd marry any number of people to prevent anything tiresome for you.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;and aylmer, of course--edith, really, i think aylmer ought to go away, i'm sure he ought.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;71;and then i should be glad i hadn't married mavis... oh, do let it be like the fourth act, edith.'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;'edith, do you think if bruce knew--how much you liked aylmer--he would have written that letter?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;'i say, edith!'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;but i suppose if there's a certain predicament--then--oh, edith--are you unhappy?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;curiously, when edith had once got over the pain and shock that the letter first gave her, she was positively happier now than she ever had been before.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;'i can't see edith in anything so crude as the--as--that court,' vincy said.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;but edith would not agree.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;so the children played and enjoyed themselves, and sometimes asked after their father, and mrs ottley, though a little anxious, enjoyed herself too, and edith had never been so happy.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;the next letter in answer to edith's would doubtless convince her, and he would then persuade her, it was, tacitly, he thought, almost agreed now, it was not spoken of between them, but he believed it was all right....

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;'i think edith wants to speak to you,' she said, as she left the room.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;'dear edith!

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;72;edith came in, in a dark dress, looking pale, and different, he thought.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74;'i can't,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74;speak to her about it, will you, edith?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74;i have always made a point of letting you do exactly as you like about the children, haven't i, edith?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74;'oh, she's only five, quite a baby,' said edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;74;since his return, edith had never once referred to bruce's sea-voyage.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;75;'do you know, edith, it has sometimes occurred to me that if--that, well--well, you know what i mean--if things had turned out differently, and you had done as i asked you--' 'well?'

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;75;you liked him very much, didn't you, edith?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10021;75;you never appreciated him, he was not the sort of man a woman would appreciate ... but he's a great loss to me, edith.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;3;"i say, diggy," exclaimed jack vance, addressing the new boy by the friendly abbreviation, which seemed by mutual consent to have been bestowed upon him in recognition of his daring exploit--"i say, diggy, you're in my bedroom,there's you, and me, and mugford.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;7;"that's just like mug," said jack vance to diggory, as the group of boys slowly dispersed, "he's always doing something stupid.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10027;7;why, he's gone and put ashes all over our slide!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;8;asked diggory, but at that moment acton came marching round the room ordering every one out into the playground, and jack vance hurried off to get his cap and muffler without replying to the question.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;8;jack vance, as he left the house, had caught up a double handful of snow, which he had been pressing into a hard ball as he ran down the path, determining in his own, mind to be the first to open fire on the snow man.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;9;i have no doubt that the average boy turned out by horace house was as good a fellow, taking him all round, as the average boy produced by the birches, and that, if they had been thrown together in one school, they would, for the most part, have made very good friends and comrades.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;9;it had been customary every term for the birchites to play a match against them either at cricket or football, but their conduct during a visit paid to the ground of the latter, back in the previous summer, had been so very ungentlemanly and unsportsmanlike that, when the next challenge arrived for an encounter at football, mr. welsby wrote back a polite note expressing regret that he did not see his way clear to permit a continuation of the matches.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;10;asked diggory, as jack vance finished a hasty account of this warfare with the philistines.

bat;Chiroptera;organism;PG10027;10;in one corner stood a wooden shed containing a carpenter's bench, a chest for bats and stumps, and various other things belonging to different boys.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10027;11;they turned off on to the grass, lest the noise should give the enemy warning of their approach, and when within about a hundred yards of horace house, pulled up to consider for a moment what their plan of action should be, before proceeding any further.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;11;diggory and jack vance dropped flat on their stomachs, for the words had hardly been uttered when the doors were flung open, and at least ten of the philistines rushed out into the road with a yell of defiance.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;12;the bell for evening preparation was ringing as they reached the birches, and only a very few hasty replies could be given to acton's eager inquiries as they rushed together up the garden path.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;12;"so we will," cried jack vance excitedly, "and that jolly quick!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;12;"i'm sure i don't know," answered jack sadly, and so the meeting terminated.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;13;grumbled jack, and promptly returned to the land of dreams.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;13;some one was pounding with his clinched fist at the door opening into locker's lane, and at the same time jack vance was heard shouting,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;13;mugford's nose was bleeding, jack vance's collar seemed to have been nearly torn off his neck, while diggory's cap was in his hand, and his hair in a state of wild disorder.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;13;shaw and morris seized hold of jack vance, and at length succeeded in shaking him into a sufficient state of sobriety to be able to answer their questions.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;14;i dropped down in a trice, and they all rushed to the doors, but they couldn't lift the latch, because mug and jack were holding fast to the stump.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;14;"yes, but that wasn't all," interrupted jack vance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;14;acton folded diggory to his breast in a loving embrace, shaw and morris stuffed the door-key down mugford's back, while the remainder of the company executed a war-dance round jack vance.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;14;the company shouted themselves hoarse, for every one felt that the honour of the birches had been retrieved, and that the day was still far distant when they would be crushed beneath the iron heel of young noaks, or be exposed as an unresisting prey to the ravages of the wild hordes of horace house.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;14;as this story is to be a history of the triple alliance, and not of the birches, it will be necessary to pass over many things which happened at the preparatory school, in order that full justice may be done to the important parts played by our three friends in an epoch of strange and stirring events at ronleigh college.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;14;acton displayed marked favour towards the triple alliance, and was even more friendly with diggory and jack vance than with his room and class mates, shaw and morris.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;14;at the very commencement of the summer term it was plain to everybody that something was wrong with the dux, he seemed to take no interest in the doings of his companions in the playground, and only once roused himself sufficiently to bang cross with a leg-guard for bowling awful wides at cricket.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;14;at length, one afternoon, diggory and jack vance on entering the shed found him sitting on the carpenter's bench, with his chin resting in his hand, and a most ferocious expression on his face.

gimlet;Eucalyptus salubris;organism;PG10027;14;well," he added, stabbing the bench with the gimlet, "i'm going to do it."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;15;"i believe it's the girl who always says that," answered jack vance, kicking a bit of wood into a corner.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;15;"yes, but fellows are often doing that," answered jack vance, "and she always wears them, either in her dress or stuck up somehow under her brooch."

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10027;15;"oh, but this was a white rose, and a white rose means something, though i don't know what.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;15;"he's shown me the letter," whispered diggory to jack vance, "only i promised i wouldn't say what was in it, but it ends up with a piece of poetry as long as this table!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;15;after morning school was the time agreed upon for the dux to cast the die which was to decide his future, and as soon as the classes were dismissed, jack vance and diggory met him by appointment in one corner of the garden.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;15;jack vance thought one, diggory said two, and the company then relapsed into silence, and stood with gloomy looks upon their faces, as though they were waiting to take part in a funeral procession.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;15;"oh, that's nothing," answered jack vance, "miss eleanor always calls fellows by their christian names.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;15;inquired jack vance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;16;acton was elected president, and by way of recognizing the mutual interest of the triple alliance, jack vance was appointed to act as secretary, and it was decided to hold the first banquet on the following night.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;17;whispered jack vance, "wasn't that something hit the door?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;17;jack vance reconnoitred the passage, while diggory and mugford examined the room, but nothing could be found to account for the disturbance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;17;how ever acton and his noble friends had managed to smuggle upstairs, under their jackets, a pork-pie, a plum-cake, a bag of tarts, and a pound of biscuits, was a feat which, as jack vance remarked, "beat conjuring."

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;18;"it can't be blake," answered acton, "he's gone to fenley to play in a cricket match, and isn't coming back till to-morrow morning.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;18;"with regard to these tools, there is a word which has never been used before in connection with any pupil at the birches, and which i hope i may never have occasion to use again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;18;acton and jack vance especially fairly boiled with wrath.

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10027;19;"look," said the latter, "i've cut a little tiny slit with my knife in each door-post, about three feet from the ground, and i'm going to stretch this piece of black cotton between them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;19;jack vance says that when he's been out shooting with his guv'nor he's seen the keeper put them across the paths in a wood to find out if poachers have been up them.

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10027;19;"there," he said, rising to his feet again, "we'll do this the last thing every night, and any morning if we find the cotton gone we must look here for footprints, and then we ought to be able to tell if it's a man or a boy."

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10027;19;"i say, the cotton's gone!"

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10027;19;i expect the piece of cotton blew away, and the foot-marks must have been there before.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;20;on returning to chatford after the summer holidays, they discovered that all three were destined to leave at christmas and proceed to ronleigh college, a large school in the neighbourhood, to which a good number of mr. welsby's former pupils had been transferred after undergoing a preliminary course of education at the birches.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;20;the records of their big scores at cricket, or their victories at football, which appeared in local papers, were always read with admiration, and the name of an old birchite appearing in either of the teams was a thing of which every one felt justly proud.

sponge;Porifera;organism;PG10027;20;it was played in the schoolroom and passages with empty ink-pots and balls of paper, in the bedrooms with slippers and sponges, and even in their dreams fellows kicked the bed-clothes off, and woke up with cries of "goal!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;21;acton took centre forward, with jack vance on his right, while diggory was told off to keep goal.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;21;at length there was a sound of voices in the lane, and the next moment the enemy entered the field, headed by their under-master, mr. fox.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;21;get away, birches!"

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;21;noaks muttered something about not funking, but mr. fox said,--

brick;Thunbergia mysorensis;organism;PG10027;21;he acquitted himself like a brick, and the last time did a thing which afforded his side an immense amount of secret satisfaction.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;21;a moment later jack vance ran into him, and took the ball from between his feet.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;22;"you are quite right, mr. blake," answered mr. fox.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;22;whispered acton, "old fox is a good sort."

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10027;22;"oh, they're most of them all right," answered morris, "it's only two or three that are such beasts."

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;22;the umpire looked at his watch, and in answer to a query from mr. fox said, "five minutes more."

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;22;cried mr. fox.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;22;it dropped in exactly the right place, and jack vance, by some happy fluke, kicked it just as it touched the ground.

fluke;Trematoda;organism;PG10027;22;it dropped in exactly the right place, and jack vance, by some happy fluke, kicked it just as it touched the ground.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;22;jack vance was seized by a band of applauding comrades, who, with his head about a couple of feet lower than his heels, carried him in triumph across the playground, and staggered half-way up the steep garden path, when acton happening to tread on a loose pebble brought the whole procession to grief, and caused the noble band of conquering heroes to be seen all grovelling in a mixed heap upon the gravel.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;22;but it is not for the simple purpose of recording the victory over horace house that a description of the match has been introduced into our story, and although the important part played by diggory in goal and jack vance in the "fighting line" caused it to be an occasion when the triple alliance was decidedly in evidence and won fresh laurels, yet there are other reasons which make an account of it necessary, as the reader will discover in following the course of subsequent events.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;22;if jack vance had kicked the ball a yard over the bar instead of under it, the probability is that the following chapter would never have been written, while the public disgrace of young noaks was destined to cause our three comrades more trouble than they ever expected to encounter, at all events on this side of their leaving school.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;22;as the three biggest boys in the school, they had little difficulty in inducing their companions to join in the crusade which they preached against the birches, and the consequence was that the two schools were soon exchanging open hostilities with greater vigour than ever.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10027;23;what this terrible outrage would have excited those who had suffered this cruel wrong to do in return--whether they would have started off there and then, burnt horace house to the ground, and hung its inhabitants on the surrounding trees--it would be hard to say, as it was, at this very moment a counter-attraction was forced upon their attention by morris, who came shouldering his way into their midst, saying,--

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;23;"oh, i say," muttered jack vance, "now there'll be a row!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;23;jack's prophecy was soon fulfilled.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;24;to do full justice to the memory of diggory trevanock, he alone stood out against this decision, and incurred the wrath both of acton and jack vance in so doing.

brick;Thunbergia mysorensis;organism;PG10027;24;as they drew near to horace house, a solitary figure was discovered standing in the shadow of the brick wall.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;25;it seemed altogether beyond their power to do anything, and yet there was not a boy who would not have given his dearest possession, were it a white rat or a stamp collection, if by parting with it he could have rendered some assistance to his ill-fated comrade.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10027;26;to imagine the disappointment of the philistines when they discovered that the bird had flown, and the chagrin of young noaks when he found that his play-box padlock was fastened to the door of the shed, was simply delightful, and acton was so carried away that he once more fell on diggory's neck, and pretended to shed tears of joy upon the latter's broad turn-down collar.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;26;"i say, diggy," exclaimed jack vance, "you are a corker! "

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;26;it was an annual custom at the birches for the boys to subscribe towards getting a display of fireworks, which were let off in the playground under the superintendence of mr. blake.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;26;"look here," exclaimed jack vance, as the triple alliance were wending their way from the playground to the house, "there's only one thing to be done, and that is, we must set miss eleanor on old welsby's track.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;26;acton seized the speaker by the neck and shook him like a rat.

plum;Prunus domestica;organism;PG10027;27;the two boys found miss eleanor making cake, and the conference began by diggory's having his ears boxed for picking plums out of the dough.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;27;miss eleanor had a dread of gunpowder, and mr. blake sent jack vance to tell noaks to carry the box as usual down into the shed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;27;"well, it isn't my orders," answered jack, "it's mr. blake's."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;27;diggory trotted off to fetch the flag, and jack vance, who was loitering about one of the passages, accompanied him down into the playground.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;27;jack heard it this time.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;27;asked jack vance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;27;jack vance fortunately had the required coin in his pocket, and diggory dropped it into joe crump's cap.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;28;come on, jack, let's go and tell acton."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;28;"we can't do that," answered jack vance, "or it'll get diggy in a row.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;28;if they come at all, they are certain to be here soon after half-past eight, because i heard fox telling blake on the day of the match that they go to bed at nine.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10027;29;after a moment's hesitation and some muttered remarks about "that there blake" and "them uppish young dogs," noaks senior led the way across the gravel, and followed by the two philistines entered the shed.

dog;Canidae;organism;PG10027;29;after a moment's hesitation and some muttered remarks about "that there blake" and "them uppish young dogs," noaks senior led the way across the gravel, and followed by the two philistines entered the shed.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;29;of the two philistines being conducted, under a strong escort, to mr. welsby's study, of a polite note being dispatched by the latter to mr. philips, and of the unmitigated delight of the birchites when hogson and noaks junior were delivered over into the hands of mr. fox, and marched off by that gentleman to take their trial at horace house.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;30;the old feud died out, giving place to a far better spirit, which was manifested each term in the friendly manner in which the teams met for matches at cricket and football.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;30;nearly a year later diggory and jack vance were sauntering arm in arm across one of the fives-courts at ronleigh college.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;30;answered jack, shrugging his shoulders.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;30;but though, after the fame they had won at the birches, it was rather humiliating at first to find themselves regarded as three nobodies, yet there was some compensation in the thought that, just as the smallest drummer-boy can point to a flag covered with "honours," and say

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10027;30;the crowd of boys, and the maze of passages, rooms, and staircases, were very confusing after the quiet, old-fashioned house at chatford, but though in this world there is no lack either of lame dogs or of stiles, there is also a good supply of kindly-disposed persons who are ever ready to help the former over the latter, and our three friends were fortunate enough to fall in with one of these philanthropic individuals soon after their arrival.

ivy;Hedera helix;organism;PG10027;31;passing through the central archway in the block of buildings which faced the road, the boys found themselves in a large gravelled quadrangle surrounded on all sides by high walls, broken by what appeared at first sight to be an almost countless number of windows, while the red brick was relieved in many places by a thick growth of ivy.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;31;they passed once more through the double doors, and were crossing the quadrangle, when a certain incident attracted their notice, unimportant in itself, but indicating a strong contrast in the manner of life at ronleigh to what they had always been accustomed to at the birches.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;31;"why, i thought it was only masters did that," said jack vance.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;31;it was very different from the cosy little bedrooms at the birches, but the three friends were glad to be allowed to undress in peace and quiet, and had scrambled safely into bed some time before the prefect put in an appearance to turn out the light.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;32;there was plenty to engage their attention, and much that was new and singular after their comparatively quiet playground at the birches.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;32;jack vance, diggory, and mugford sat together at the first desk, just in front of the master's table, and were soon busy in proving their previous acquaintance with the latin grammar.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;32;jack vance looked at mugford, and mugford looked at diggory.

cucumber;Cucumis sativus;organism;PG10027;32;young noaks, however, walked up cool as a cucumber, and holding out his hand said,--

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;32;"i say," he continued, addressing jack vance, "were you at todderton these holidays?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;32;"the last time i saw you," returned jack, in rather a bitter tone, "was when you came to spoil our fireworks, and we collared you in the shed."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;33;"it was no such thing," answered jack.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10027;33;"i'm sure i shouldn't fly into a wax if you called fox or old phillips a fool.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10027;33;they certainly were an amusing lot of little animals, and diggory and his companions coming into the classroom rather late, and before the entrance of the master, saw them for the first time to full advantage.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;34;down in the box-room, a good-sized apartment boarded off from the gymnasium, jack vance was serving out a ration of plum-cake to a select party, consisting of his two chums and carton, when the ex-philistine strolled up and joined himself to the group.

sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG10027;34;noaks certainly seemed to have discovered a chum in the black sheep of the upper fourth, and the triple alliance began to congratulate themselves that he would trouble them no further.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;35;"old mug is rather a fool," remarked jack vance to diggory a few hours later, "he ought to have seen through that.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;35;jack vance and diggory soon became popular members of "the happy family," and their loyalty to mugford caused the latter's path to be much smoother than it probably would have been had he been compelled to tread it alone.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;35;"rats," took a great fancy to jack, while maxton repeated his assertion that young trevanock was "the right sort," and as a further mark of his favour presented the new-comer with a moleskin of his own curing, which looked very nice, but, as "rats" put it, "smelt rather fruity."

bat;Chiroptera;organism;PG10027;36;an array of silver cups, several photographs of cricket and football teams, and a miscellaneous pile of bats, fencing-sticks, indian clubs, etc., standing in one corner, all spoke of the athlete, while carelessly thrown down on the top of a cupboard was an article for the possession of which many a, boy would have bartered the whole of his worldly wealth--a bit of worn blue velvet and the tarnished remnant of what had once been a gold tassel--the "footer cap" of ronleigh college.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;36;you were at the birches, that school near chatford, weren't you?

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10027;36;it was an awful thing to beard the lion in his den--for a new boy to face so great a personage as the football captain, and refuse point-blank to do as he was told.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;37;the subject of this remark hurried away, and had just joined the crowd of boys who were thronging into the big school for assembly, when some one took hold of his arm, and glancing round he was startled to see jack vance, looking very excited and dishevelled, and mopping his mouth with a blood-stained handkerchief.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10027;37;i went to the rescue, and the beast hit me with the back of his hand here on the mouth.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;37;it is probable that, if this had happened at horace house, jack vance would have received a good licking as soon as the classes were dismissed, but a few very plain and forcible words spoken by rowlands on the subject of knocking small boys about caused noaks to postpone his retaliation.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;37;"look here," he said, meeting jack vance in the quadrangle during the interval,"just you keep your mouth shut about me and my father.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;37;"you must come," said "rats" to diggory, "it'll be an awful lark."

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;37;"rats," beaming with delight, "and i have got a whole heap of paper bags i'm going to burst while fletcher's speaking."

brick;Thunbergia mysorensis;organism;PG10027;37;the "old lab," as it was called, was a small brick building which stood on one side of the asphalt playground.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;38;blowing up another bag, which caused a fresh burst of laughter.

cuckoo;Cuculidae;organism;PG10027;38;"no, you cuckoo!

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;38;"look here, young 'rats,' if you burst any more of those bags i'll come down and burst your head.

bat;Chiroptera;organism;PG10027;38;one facetious class-mate, standing close to the sink, offered to sell him by auction, and hammering on the stones with the fragment of a bat handle, knocked him down for threepence to another joker, who said he'd do for a pen-wiper.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;38;"the magazine is to be written on exercise-book paper," began bibbs, and had only got thus far when he was interrupted by a perfect salvo of paper bags which little "rats" discharged in quick succession.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;38;the majority of those present siding with "rats," began to hustle fletcher, while two gentlemen having dragged bibbs from his perch, jumped up in his stead, and began to execute a clog-dance.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;40;they wrote letters to miss eleanor and to their former schoolfellows, and received in reply the latest news from the birches.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;40;"oh, he's all right," answered jack vance, "that row's blown over now.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;40;"i shall go home," said jack vance to his two chums, "todderton's only about half an hour's ride from here on the railway.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;40;"of course she will, if i ask her," answered jack, and straightway sat down to write the letter.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;40;at length saturday came, and as soon as morning school was over they rushed upstairs to change into their best clothes, and having crammed their night-shirts, brushes and combs, etc., into a hand-bag, hurried off to the railway station, in order that they might, as jack put it, "be home in time for dinner."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;40;said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;40;jack vance lived in the suburbs of todderton, about twenty minutes' walk from the railway, but for all that he managed to carry out his intention of being home in time for dinner, and the three boys, after receiving a hearty welcome, were soon seated down to a repast which came very acceptable after seven weeks of school fare.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;40;"jack," said mr. vance, "you know that house that was to let just on the other side of the hermitage?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;40;"he isn't my friend," answered jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;41;said jack, speaking with his mouth pretty full,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;41;the conversation turned on other topics, and when at length they rose from the table, jack proposed a stroll round the garden.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;41;there were many things to see--some pet rabbits, a swing, and an old summer-house, which jack, being, we should say, of a decidedly nautical turn of mind, had turned into a sort of miniature shipbuilding yard for the construction of model vessels, though at present the chief use to which the place seemed to have been put was the production of a great amount of chips and shavings.

brick;Thunbergia mysorensis;organism;PG10027;41;they strolled off down the path, and soon reached a long stretch of brick wall, the top of which was thickly covered with fragments of broken bottles.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;41;"there's a place down at the other end where we can get over," said jack.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10027;41;the hermitage was surrounded on all sides by a thick mass of shrubs and trees, through which a moment later the triple alliance were cautiously threading their way.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10027;41;emerging from the bushes, they found themselves standing on a gravel path, green with moss and weeds, which ran round the house--a queer, dilapidated-looking building, which seemed sadly in want of repair,the plaster was cracked and discoloured, while the doors and windows had long stood in need of a fresh coating of paint.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;41;"oh, it's all right, there's nobody about," answered jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;41;"oh, there's no fear of that," answered jack, who was always infected with the adventurous spirit of his chum.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;41;jack vance joined him immediately, and mugford, not wishing to be left alone outside, was not long in making up his mind to follow his companions.

mahogany;Swietenia;organism;PG10027;42;book-shelves, and cupboards with glass doors, containing geological and other specimens, occupied much of the wall space, while in the centre of the floor stood a large writing-table, covered with a miscellaneous collection of pens, ink-pots, bundles of papers, and a polished mahogany box which could easily be recognized as a microscope-case.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;42;"i say," exclaimed jack vance, "look there,he don't seem very careful how he leaves his things when he goes away."

turnip;Brassica rapa;organism;PG10027;42;the loud ticking of mugford's old turnip of a watch was distinctly audible in the silence which followed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;42;ages seemed to pass while jack vance and mugford stood in the dark passage awaiting their companion's return.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;42;"you are a great ass, diggy, to go giving us a start like that," said jack, as they paused for a moment to take breath before returning to the house.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;42;jack's father rose from his chair, remarking, in a jocular manner,

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10027;42;"did either of you hear the dog bark last night?"

dog;Canidae;organism;PG10027;42;"did either of you hear the dog bark last night?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;42;jack stared at mugford, and mugford stared at diggory, but none of them spoke.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;43;asked jack faintly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;60;jack vance reported that the robbery of "the hermit's" coins was regarded at todderton as quite a piece of ancient history, and as noaks appeared to have forgotten the existence of the clasp-knife, and, growing every day more intimate with thurston and co., seemed more than ever inclined to go his way and leave his former foes alone, the latter made up their minds to banish dull care, and consider their unfortunate misadventure as a storm which they had safely weathered.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;61;"well, i call that rot," cried jack vance,"the team doesn't belong to allingford or to anybody else--"

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;61;i am inclined to think that a much nobler spirit would pervade such field-sports as cricket and football if the fact could be more firmly impressed upon the minds of both players and spectators that, providing the conduct of each side is fair and generous, and that every one does his "big best," it is equally creditable to lose as to win.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;61;something in these doggerel lines excited jack vance's wrath above measure, the last verse especially raising his anger to boiling-point, so that it fairly bubbled over.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;63;his two friends, however, weighed down with anxiety, and with dismal forebodings as to the result of the coming conflict, were obliged to seek support by informing "rats" of what was about to take place, and begging him to give them the benefit of his cheering company.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;63;answered jack stolidly, and all further attempt at pacification was abandoned.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;63;jack vance knew very little about the "noble art," except that it was the proper thing to hit straight from the shoulder, and following out this fundamental principle, he succeeded in landing his opponent a good hard drive between the eyes, which made him see more stars than are to be witnessed at the explosion of a sixpenny rocket.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;63;jack, on the other hand, emboldened by his previous success, made an unwise attempt to rush the fighting, and was rewarded with a sounding smack on the cheek-bone which broke the skin and sent him staggering back into the arms of diggory.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;63;from fletcher and andson, they closed again, and after a sharp interchange of rather random pounding, jack smote his opponent on the nose, and received in return a heavy blow on the chest which very nearly sent him to the ground.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;64;grundy disappeared round the corner of the building, but allingford remained for a moment or two, watching jack vance as he fastened on his collar and resumed his coat.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;64;"oh no," answered jack, laughing,"it began about that lot of verses that was pinned upon the notice-board this morning.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;64;that look was worth fifty bruises, and for it jack would have continued the fight with grundy to the bitter end.

gull;Larus;organism;PG10027;66;in connection with this article of furniture gull one evening introduced a new pastime, which he called putting fellows in the stocks, and which consisted in decoying innocent small boys into taking a seat, then suddenly pushing them backwards on to the floor, and imprisoning their feet between the form and the reversible desk--a position from which they only extricated themselves with considerable difficulty.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;67;an attempt to put "rats" in the stocks utterly failed, from the fact that those who were usually foremost in acts of disorder refused to render any assistance, and even went so far as to nip the disturbance in the bud with angry ejaculations of "here, dry up!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;67;jack and diggory listened in amazement to the uproar with which they suddenly found themselves surrounded, and not wishing to risk the chance of having a form or a table upset on their toes, remained seated in their corner, wondering how the affair would end.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;68;apparently the whole of the row and disturbance of the previous evening was the handiwork of one single boy, and that boy the youthful "rats."

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;68;"i was reading--and the gas went out--and some one emptied a box of chess-men over my head--and i--i hit him--and then there was a lot of pushing, and i pushed, and--" concluded "rats" apologetically--

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;69;the reading-room row, as it was called, had pretty well blown over, when one morning diggory accosted jack vance and mugford, who were both seated at the latter's desk, sharpening their knives on an oil-stone.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;70;jack vance handed him the required article, which happened to be of the kind which fit all watches.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;70;"no," answered jack vance.

chestnut;Castanea;organism;PG10027;71;they rushed down the stairs, scattering a group of small boys who were roasting chestnuts at the gas-jet in the passage, and on through the box-room, but only to find the door on the other side standing wide open, and the gymnasium itself silent and deserted--two empty water-cans, lying in a big pool of wet on the cement floor, being the only remaining traces of the recent outrage.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;80;asked jack, as the three friends prepared to break up their "confab."

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;80;my stars, i was glad 'rats' had only given me one instead of the box!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;80;"it all came about," so said jack vance, "through carton's having the cheek to go home some ten days before proper time."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;80;cried jack.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;80;why, you'll miss all the fun of breaking up, and young 'rats' is making up a party to fill a carriage, and we're going to have a fine spree.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;80;"yes, but the question is if we've got any money," answered jack vance ruefully.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;81;asked jack, as he paid the money for their fare to the ticket-collector.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;81;jack's face fell.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;81;"it's five-and-twenty past four," said jack vance, looking at his watch,

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10027;81;"it's a good bit shorter by rail," mused diggory, "if we could walk along the line.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;81;"oh, bother that," cried jack vance, suddenly smitten with diggory's idea.

sleeper;Eleotridae;organism;PG10027;81;the trio started off in the direction indicated, hurrying along the permanent way, hopping over the sleepers, and seeing how far they could run on one of the metals without falling off.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10027;81;the ground seemed to be plentifully strewn with ashes, which scrunched under their feet as they plodded along, and their voices sounded hollow and strange.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;81;"my eye," said jack, "it's precious dark.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;81;the boys were walking in single file, diggory leading, and jack vance bringing up the rear.

sleeper;Eleotridae;organism;PG10027;81;"i say," exclaimed the latter, as he stumbled over a sleeper,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;82;"stop a minute," cried jack, emboldened by the prospect of soon being once more in the fresh air, "let's see if we can make an echo."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;82;the little party halted for a moment, but instead of hearing the shrill yell for the production of which jack had just filled his lungs, their ears were greeted with a far more terrible sound, which caused their hearts to stop beating.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;82;"come along," cried jack vance, "let's bolt."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;82;"come along," repeated jack vance, and the next moment he and his two companions were clambering as fast as they could up the steep side of the embankment, clutching at bushes and tufts of grass, and causing miniature landslips of sand and gravel with every step they took.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10027;82;"come along," repeated jack vance, and the next moment he and his two companions were clambering as fast as they could up the steep side of the embankment, clutching at bushes and tufts of grass, and causing miniature landslips of sand and gravel with every step they took.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10027;82;"come along," repeated jack vance, and the next moment he and his two companions were clambering as fast as they could up the steep side of the embankment, clutching at bushes and tufts of grass, and causing miniature landslips of sand and gravel with every step they took.

grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10027;82;"come along," repeated jack vance, and the next moment he and his two companions were clambering as fast as they could up the steep side of the embankment, clutching at bushes and tufts of grass, and causing miniature landslips of sand and gravel with every step they took.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;82;jack vance and diggory, whose powers of wind and limb had benefited by constant exercise in the football field, were soon at the top, but mugford, who was not inclined to be athletic, and who had already been pretty nearly pumped in hurrying out of the tunnel, was still slowly dragging himself up the ascent, panting and puffing like a steam-engine, when his comrades reached the summit.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;82;in this posture he tobogganed down the slope, with more force than elegance, and with a yell of triumph jack and diggory stretched out their hands, and dragged mugford up to the level grassy plateau on which they stood.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10027;83;close behind them was a wood, and without a moment's hesitation they plunged through the hedge, and dashed on through the bushes.

dead leaf;Kallima inachus;organism;PG10027;83;the dry twigs cracked, and the dead leaves rustled beneath their feet.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;83;"oh," panted jack, "it's one of the keepers!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;83;then as jack vance and diggory stood staring blankly at each other in the deepening winter twilight, they suddenly blossomed out into heroes-- heroes, it is true, in flannel cricket-caps and turned-down collars, but heroes, at all events to my mind, as genuine in the spirit which prompted their action as those whose deeds are known in song and story.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10027;83;the barking of a dog in the field above showed that the keeper was following up their trail.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;83;said jack and diggory in one voice, and the latter, sticking his hands in his trouser pockets, began to whistle.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10027;83;there was a clatter of wheels, the quick stamp of a fast-trotting horse, and a baker's cart came swinging round the corner.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;83;"i say," cried jack, "this is a stroke of good luck.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;84;"i hope no one sees us," said jack vance.

gull;Larus;organism;PG10027;85;the gilt was beginning to wear off the thurstonian gingerbread, and sensible fellows, who could tell the difference between jewel and paste, were less inclined than ever to be led by the nose by such fellows as gull and hawley.

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;85;if only ronleigh could beat the grammar school this year at footer as well as at cricket, every one felt that their cup of joy would run over, and the champions who were to strive for the wished-for victory were naturally regarded, for the time being, as standing on more exalted ground than their fellows.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;85;cried jack vance, "what's up?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;86;at the near prospect of separation all mugford's little failings were forgotten, and both diggory and jack vance felt that life without him would be a blank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;86;the idea of jack vance addressing a remonstrance to his respected parent caused the ghost of a smile to appear on mugford's doleful face.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;86;"it's all very well," said jack vance to diggory, when late on in the afternoon he happened to come across the latter flattening his nose against the glass of the box-room window--"it's all very well talking about writing and all that, but this is the end of the triple alliance."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;86;said jack vance, "they're at it again!"

brick;Thunbergia mysorensis;organism;PG10027;86;his companion made no reply, but taking out a pencil, copied the cipher on the back of an envelope, and then replaced the mysterious document in the crack between the window-frame and the bricks.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;86;"why, because they may miss it, and smell a rat.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;86;queried jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;86;asked jack vance, "it's rather a risky business."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;86;during the half-hour between tea and evening preparation jack vance and mugford lingered about in the dark and deserted quadrangle, anxiously awaiting their comrade's return.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;86;once only was the silence broken, by maxton chasing young "rats" from the gymnasium into the big school, shouting, "i'll lick you, you little villain!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;86;jack vance and his companion trotted softly up and down, endeavouring to keep themselves warm.

gull;Larus;organism;PG10027;87;asked gull.

gull;Larus;organism;PG10027;88;noaks murmured his approval of the scheme, but gull and hawley were silent.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;89;retorted jack vance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;89;"of course," added jack vance, "they'd evidently arranged it beforehand, and that paper was to say when they were to do the trick."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;89;"i don't see exactly how you can prove it," said jack vance thoughtfully, "that one word 'to-night' might mean anything."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;90;exclaimed jack vance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;90;"no, i'll come too," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;90;allingford's face was very white, and oaks's very red, "for all the world like the wars of the roses," as jack vance afterwards remarked, though it would be difficult to clearly understand the simile.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;91;diggory's face wore something of the same expression which jack and mugford had seen upon it when long ago their friend first distinguished himself at the birches by going down the slide on skates.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;91;diggory's face wore something of the same expression which jack and mugford had seen upon it when long ago their friend first distinguished himself at the birches by going down the slide on skates.

skate;Bathyraja;organism;PG10027;91;diggory's face wore something of the same expression which jack and mugford had seen upon it when long ago their friend first distinguished himself at the birches by going down the slide on skates.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;91;"well," said the doctor, turning to jack vance and mugford, when their companion had finished speaking, "and what have you two got to say?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;91;"we were afraid to, sir," faltered jack vance, "and we thought it would be sneaking."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;91;jack vance leaned over to whisper something in his ear, when their attention was attracted by an exclamation of surprise from dr. denson.

gull;Larus;organism;PG10027;91;"oaks," said the doctor, "go and give my compliments to mr. cowland, and ask him to open school for me, and at the same time inform the following boys that i wish to see them at once, here in my study,fletcher one, thurston, gull, hawley, and noaks."

gull;Larus;organism;PG10027;92;gull and hawley, however, anxious at all costs to save their own skins, practically answered the question by saying, "we didn't," and casting significant glances at noaks and fletcher.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;93;he's never forgiven us since that time he was turned off the football field for striking you at the birches."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;93;"no," added jack vance, "and then we were the means of old noaks getting the sack over those fireworks, and that reminds me he's always had a grudge against me for letting out that time that his father was a servant man, and now there's this last row.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;93;exclaimed jack vance, with forced bravado, "he can't prove we stole the coins."

cricket;Gryllidae;organism;PG10027;93;allingford and his men journeyed to the neighbouring town, so gaming the additional credit of a victory on their opponents' ground, and thus, for the first time for many years, ronleigh lowered the flag of their ancient rivals both at cricket and at football.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;93;cried "rats," who was in a great state of excitement when the news arrived, "they won't ask us again if we'd like to play a master, the cheeky beggars!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;94;the idea was that the little fraternity should celebrate their approaching separation, and the consequent breaking up of their association, with a sort of funeral feast, the cost of which jack and diggory insisted should be borne by the two surviving members.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;94;only one outsider was invited to attend--namely, "rats," whose cheery presence it was thought would tend to enliven the proceedings, and chase away the gloomy clouds of regret which would naturally hang over the near prospect of parting.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;94;"none of the fellows'll come near it," said jack vance, "and if old watford should be knocking round and catch us there, he won't do anything to-day, we shall have to clear out, that's all."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;94;jack vance carried two big paper bags, diggory a biscuit-box and a small tin kettle, while the other two were provided with four clean jam-pots, it having been announced that there was "going to be some cocoa."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;94;for the preparation of this luxury diggory mounted a form and lit one of the gas-jets, over which he and jack vance took it in turns to hold the kettle until the water boiled.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;94;even the gallant efforts of "rats" to enliven the party were of no avail, and for some time everybody munched away in silence, jack vance occasionally pausing to remark, "here, pass over that nose-bag, and help yourselves."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;94;"well," said jack vance, suddenly broaching the subject which was uppermost in each of their minds, "we've had jolly times together.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;94;d'you remember when we made the alliance, the day you first came to the birches, diggory?"

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;94;one reminiscence suggested another, and after exhausting their recollections of the birches, they recalled their varied experiences at ronleigh.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;94;at length, when the paper bags had been wellnigh emptied, jack vance intimated his intention of making a speech--which announcement was received with considerable applause.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;94;we've been friends a long time, and both here and at the birches, as diggory says, the triple alliance has done wonders and covered itself with glory."

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;94;"i wish 'rats' could have joined us, but then i suppose it wouldn't have been the triple alliance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;95;"no, we haven't," interrupted jack vance.

birch;Betula;organism;PG10027;95;you made friends with me because i happened to be in the same room at the birches, but you always stuck to me, and helped me along a lot when we came here first.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;95;you must take 'rats' in my place.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;95;jack vance tried to crack a joke, but it was a miserable failure.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;95;"there was something i wanted to say," began "rats" thoughtfully.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;95;"rats" scrambled to his feet and hurried out of the room.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;95;jack vance pulled out his watch, and held it down so that the glimmer of the red light from between the bars of the stove fell upon its face.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;95;a moment later "rats" came scampering down the passage.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;95;diggory relighted the gas-jet which he had turned out after boiling the kettle, and proceeded, with the assistance of "rats," to gather up the remains of the feast.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;95;they had hardly, however, got further than emptying the tin kettle down the ventilator before their attention was attracted by a joyful exclamation from jack vance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;96;gasped jack vance, "and we've just dissolved the alliance!

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10027;96;shouted "rats," "diggory said you wouldn't.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10027;96;"well, so it shall be," cried jack vance, embracing mugford with the hugging power of a juvenile bear,"next term we'll start afresh."

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;32;mindful of his promise to edith morriston, hugh gifford kept about the town with the object of coming across henshaw and getting to know, if possible, something of his intentions.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;32;a clever girl like edith morriston, more sensitive than to a casual observer would appear, had naturally recognized this danger and was anxious to have the man, with his, perhaps, none too scrupulous methods, held in check, and to this service gifford was only too happy to devote himself, glad beyond measure that the opportunity had been given him by the girl who had filled his thoughts.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;33;he presently took an opportunity of joining edith morriston in the garden.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;34;one thing, however, gifford did not like, and that was henshaw's rather obvious admiration for edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;34;he wondered whether in the absence of any other apparent cause, edith morriston's attractiveness had had anything to do with it.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;36;he strolled out one afternoon, aimlessly, wondering whether the negative result of his efforts justified his remaining in the place, and yet loath to leave it, held there as he was by the attraction of edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;36;it was, in its unexpectedness, an almost appalling sight to him, as he realised that the two were none other than henshaw and edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;36;henshaw and edith morriston!

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10029;36;he stooped, and creeping warily beyond the fringe of trees looked after the pair.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;36;there could be no doubt that the lady was edith morriston, and the man?

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10029;36;they had stopped now, at the end of the ride, the man talking earnestly, it seemed, miss morriston standing with head bent down and scoring the grass with her walking-stick as though in doubt or consideration.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;37;he hated the idea of spying upon edith morriston, after all, if she chose to walk and talk with this man it was no business of his, but a supreme distrust of henshaw, unreasonable enough, perhaps, but none the less keen, made him suspicious that the man might be playing some cowardly game, might have drawn the girl to him by unfair means.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10029;37;he could catch but a glimpse of them through the intervening trees as they went by slowly, but it was enough to tell him that henshaw was talking earnestly, arguing, it seemed, and on edith morriston's clear-cut face was a look of trouble which was not good to see.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;37;henshaw had been caught and fascinated by edith morriston's beauty, and being, as was obvious, a man of energy and determination, was now in some subtle way making use of the tragedy as a means of forcing his unwelcome attentions on her.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;37;of course the man was waiting either to waylay edith morriston or to meet her by appointment.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;37;that henshaw's object was more or less disreputable could not be doubted, and to gifford the amazing and troubling part of it was that edith morriston, the very last woman he would have suspected of consenting to such a course, who had professed an absolute dislike and repugnance to henshaw, and fear of his annoying presence, should be meeting him thus willingly.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;38;that this unpleasantly sharp, pushing product of the less dignified side of the law could have any personal attraction for one of edith morriston's taste and discrimination was impossible.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;38;was it possible that this man could have found out something connecting edith morriston with his brother's death?

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;38;"well," kelson answered, "it appears that edith morriston's maid found them some days ago, in fact the day after a similar discovery had been made on muriel's gown.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;39;i wonder whether edith morriston has any idea as to how her dress got marked."

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;39;and he was now making use of it to put the screw on, using the hold he had gained over edith morriston to bend her to his will.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;39;thinking out the situation strenuously gifford determined to seek a private interview with edith morriston and offer himself as her protector.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;39;anyhow in consideration of the trust edith morriston had shown in him he would seek an interview with her and chance what it might bring forth.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;40;nevertheless he determined to go and do his best to get a private talk with edith morriston, however disinclined she might be to grant it.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;40;edith morriston seemed as friendly and gracious as ever, but whether by accident or design she gave no chance for gifford to get in a private word.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;41;but his expression changed as he glanced at edith morriston, she had denied that she had been in the room.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42;anyhow it is a source of congratulation to miss tredworth and you, edith.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42;morriston said cheerfully.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42;involuntarily gifford had glanced at edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42;"let's hope to announce that at last they are going to leave you in peace, edith," miss tredworth said.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42;edith morriston did not alter her position as she stood looking out of the window.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42;you too, edith, and miss tredworth, there is nothing at all horrible in it so far."

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42;for the first time edith morriston turned from the window.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;42;gifford was the last to leave the room, and his glance back showed him that edith morriston had turned again to the window and resumed her former attitude.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;44;edith morriston was no longer there.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;45;"i am waiting for edith," she said.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;45;"we'll stroll on and gifford can bring miss morriston after us," kelson suggested, and the lovers moved away, leaving gifford, much to his satisfaction, waiting for edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;45;edith morriston was thinking strenuously, desperately, he could see that.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;47;edith morriston's eyes were fixed with something like fear on an object behind him.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;47;chapter xix in the churchyard nothing more of importance happened that day at wynford, and gifford had no further opportunity of private talk with edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;47;that he was intimidating her, and using his brother's death for that purpose, was beyond doubt, and the very fact that edith morriston was a woman of uncommon courage and self-control, one who in ordinary circumstances would be the last to give way to fear or submit to bullying, showed how serious the matter had become.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;47;and a significant circumstance which came to gifford's knowledge a day or two after his interview with edith morriston in the garden of wynford, was the cause of his beginning to take action without further delay.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;48;naturally gifford's suspicions connected edith morriston with the circumstance, and yet he told himself the idea was monstrously improbable.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;48;it did seem absurd to imagine that henshaw with his conveyance could be waiting there by appointment for a girl of the character and position of edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;48;his heart gave a leap, for although the woman's face and figure were indistinguishable the height and gait corresponded with those of edith morriston.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;49;chapter xx an involuntary eavesdropper as she heard the words edith morriston stood for a moment as though transfixed, and then staggered back grasping at a tombstone for support.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;50;"yes, i remember he arrived quite early," edith morriston murmured.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;51;there was a catch of growing excitement in edith morriston's voice, which was scarcely above a whisper.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;51;edith morriston glanced quickly at gifford as he uttered the reflection.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;57;"the story i have to tell you, mr. gifford," edith morriston began, "is not a pleasant one and is as humiliating to me to relate as was the experience, the terrible experience, i had to go through.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;60;"it was unspeakably sad," edith morriston continued, "but it seemed like fate, seeing how things rearranged themselves afterwards.

edith;Nesophontes edithae;organism;PG10029;63;chapter xxv defiance for some moments henshaw did not speak, indeed, it was probable that the unexpected success of his search for edith morriston--for such doubtless was his object--had so disagreeably startled him, that he was unable to pull those sharp wits of his together at once.

parrot;Psittaciformes;organism;PG10031;75;here, then, immediately arose the idea of a non -reasoning creature capable of speech, and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance, suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a raven as equally capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended tone .

bird;Aves;organism;PG10031;76;the idea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a "tapping" at the door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader's curiosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from the lover's throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence adopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that knocked.

alder;Alnus;organism;PG10038;136;his last clear thought had been an intense anxiety about his snow-shoes as they sailed away, two liberated kites, but as he went on falling, clutching at the air--falling--and felt the alder twigs snap under his hands, he said to himself, "this is death," but calmly, as if it were a small matter compared to losing one's snow-shoes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;"i want you to continue to be friends with jack," she went on, and her face lighted up, and her voice grew tender.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;jack says there are no such things as trifles in a harmonious and well-proportioned life, and i suppose that's true to men of genius.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;musgrave cast about vainly for an appropriate speech.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;oh, yes, anne loved jack charteris!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;you have to live with jack to really appreciate him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;why, i remember--well, before jack made his first hit with astaroth's lackey , he lived with his sister.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;they hadn't any money, and, of course, jack couldn't be expected to take a clerkship or anything like that, because business details make his head ache, poor boy.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;but jack pointed out, with considerable reason, that one person could live very comfortably on an income that had formerly supported two.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;53;jack was so sensitive, you see, lest people might think he was making a mercenary marriage, and that his sister was profiting by it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;54;i have to watch over him carefully, not that i distrust him, of course, for--dear jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;54;who actually made me believe--however, jack explained all that, after i had made both a spectacle and a nuisance of myself, and he had behaved so nobly in the entire affair that for days afterwards i was positively limp with repentance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;54;jack says she is one of the most attractive women he ever met.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;54;"jack says, though-- are cleverness and beauty the main things in life, rudolph?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;54;jack says a man loves a woman, not for her beauty or any other quality she possesses, but just because she is the woman he loves and can't help loving."

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10041;69;so i had dreamed of love in a cottage--an idyl of blissful poverty, where cupid contents himself with crusts and kisses, and mocks at the proverbial wolf on the doorstep.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;69;patricia shivered here.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;69;and i mean to have it with you, jack--just you!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;69;i could work, too, jack dear.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;70;"dear boy," she murmured, "don't you see it's just these constant proofs of the greatness and the wonderfulness of your love--really, though, jack, wasn't it too horrid of me to misunderstand you so?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;70;ah, jack, we will be so utterly happy that i am almost afraid to think of it!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;70;really, jack, both our better-halves are horribly commonplace and they will be much better off without us."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;71;but at best, a woman can be really happy through love alone, jack dear, and it's only when we are young and good to look at that men care for us, after that, there is nothing left but to take to either religion or hand-embroidery, so what does it matter, after all?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;71;jack, i am only a vain and frivolous person of superlative charm, but i love you very much, my dear, and i solemnly swear to commit suicide the moment my first wrinkle arrives.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;71;she hurried on,"jack, kneel down at once, and swear that you are perfectly sore with loving me, as that ridiculous person says in dickens, and whose name i never could remember.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;73;"beyond doubt," said musgrave, in his soul, "jack is colossal!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;73;jack says i am a bit illogical at times.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;74;ah, rudolph, it was very dear and sweet and foolish, the way we loved each other, but you don't mind--very, very much--do you, if i think jack is the best man in the world, and by far the best man in the world for me?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;74;a woman appreciates that, rudolph, she wants her husband to be always her lover, just as jack is, and never to give in when she coaxes--because she only coaxes when she knows she is in the wrong--and never, never, to let her see him shaving himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;74;if a husband observes these simple rules, rudolph, his wife will be a happy woman, and jack does.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;74;she cried, "how horrid of you, how mean of you, to come here and suggest the possibility of jack's dying or running away from me, or doing anything dreadful like that!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;74;i got started on the subject of jack, and imagined all sorts of horrible and impossible things.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;76;"i hope so, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;76;"good-night, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;76;"no, just a moment, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;76;jack, do you remember suggesting that my father's correspondence during the war might be of value, and that his desk ought to be overhauled?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;76;"there were some letters which in a measure concern you, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;77;jack was his half-brother.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10041;77;in noveldom or in a melodrama this discovery would have transformed their mutual dealings, but as a workaday world's fact, musgrave would not honestly say that it had in any way affected his feelings toward jack, and it appeared to have left charteris equally unaltered.

sleeper;Eleotridae;organism;PG10050;1;all was quiet in the house,soft breathing of the sleepers, soft murmuring of the spring wind outside, a wintry moon very clear and full in the skies, a little town all hushed and quiet, everything lying defenceless, unconscious, in the safe keeping of god.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10050;1;she thought all at once of a summer morning when she was a child, when she had woke in the deep night which yet was day, early, so early that the birds were scarcely astir, and had risen up with a delicious sense of daring and of being all alone in the mystery of the sunrise, in the unawakened world which lay at her feet to be explored, as if she were eve just entering upon eden.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10050;8;and so she smiled all the more, and held out her hands and said, "i am sure i know you," upon which the other kissed her and said, "we all know each other, but i have seen you often before you came here," and knelt down by her, among the flowers that were growing, just in front of some tall lilies that grew over her, and made a lovely canopy over her head.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10050;20;the pilgrim would have liked to pause at every moment to see one lovely thing or another, but the painter walked on steadily till he came to a room which was full of sketches, some of them like pictures in little, with many figures,--some of them only a representation of a flower, or the wing of a bird.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10050;22;but every day as he rode out he saw at one door a child, a little fair boy, who sat on the steps, and sang his little song like a bird.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10050;22;this child was never afraid of anything,--when the horses pranced past him, and the troopers pushed him aside, he looked up into their faces and smiled.

apple;Malus domestica;organism;PG10050;22;and when he had anything, a piece of bread, or an apple, or a plaything, he shared it with his playmates, and his little face, and his pretty voice, and all his pleasant ways, made that corner bright.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;25;she was walking on in this pleasant way, when she heard a sound that was like silver trumpets, and saw the crowd turn towards an open space in which all the beautiful buildings were shaded with fine trees, and flowers were springing at the very edge of the pavements.

plant;Plantae;organism;PG10050;28;the little pilgrim was not weary, but the lady placed her upon a couch in the porch, where the pillars and the roof were all formed of interlacing plants and flowers, and there they sat with her, and talked, and explained to her many things.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;30;and now she found herself at a distance from the great city, which shone in the light with its beautiful towers, and roofs, and all its monuments, softly fringed with trees, and set in a heavenly firmament.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;30;the path lay along the bank of the river which flowed beside her and made the air full of music, and a soft air blew across the running stream and breathed in her face and refreshed her, and the birds sang in all the trees.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;31;and they told her how the lord himself would come among them, and sit down under a tree, and tell them one of his parables, and make them all more happy than words could say, and how sometimes he would send one out of the beautiful city, with a poem or tale to say to them, and bands of lovely music, more lovely than anything beside, except the sound of the lord's own voice.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10050;32;they sat down by the roadside under the shade of the trees,--while the river ran softly by, and everything was hushed out of sympathy and kindness,--and questioned each other of all that had been and was to be.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;1;one fair morning while she turned over these thoughts in her mind there suddenly came towards her one whom she knew as a sage, of the number of those who know many mysteries and search into the deep things of the father.

plant;Plantae;organism;PG10051;2;it was narrow and rough, and the skies were dim, and as she went on by the side of her guide she saw houses and gardens which were to her like the houses that children build, and the little gardens in which they sow seeds and plant flowers, and take them up again to see if they are growing.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;2;she turned to the sage, saying, 'what are--?'

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;2;'if anything comes into your heart to do or say, it will be well for them,' the sage replied,and he took her by the hand and led her into a house she knew.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;3;and the sage who was her companion soothed her with kind words.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;3;the sage only shook his head at her, smiling.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;4;said the sage, and when she listened she heard the sound of the children going back with a great murmur and ringing of pleasant voices like silver bells in the air, and among them the voice of the child asking a thousand questions, calling them by their names.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;4;the sage said in her ear.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;5;as she came forth again comforted, she found the sage standing with his face lifted to heaven, smiling still at the sound, though faint and distant, of the children all calling to each other and shouting together as they reached the gate.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;6;the sage made her a sign to follow, and these two tender companions accompanied her who saw them not, walking darkling by the silent way.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;6;'it is the secret of the lord,' said the sage, but not even they had seen him passing by.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;7;'at his own time,' said the sage, 'and in his own way.'

brier;Erica arborea;organism;PG10051;7;though she was herself among the blessed, yet the thorns and briers of the earth caught at her garments and pierced her tender feet.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;8;'little sister,' said the sage, 'to us who are born of the earth it is hard to remember that the child belongs not first to the parents, nor the husband to the wife, nor the wife to the husband, but that all are the children of the father.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;8;'he will come when all things are ready,' said the sage, and as they went upon their way be showed her other sights, and the mysteries of the heart of man, and the great patience of our lord.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10051;8;the air was fresh with the dew, and the birds awaking in the trees, and the breeze so sweet that it seemed to blow from heaven, and to the two travellers it seemed almost in the joy of the new day as if the lord had already come.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;9;the air seemed in a moment to be full of the sound of footsteps, and of something more subtle, which the sage and the pilgrim knew to be wings, and as they looked, there grew before them the semblance of a court of justice, with accusers and defenders, but the judge and the criminal were one.

old wife;Enoplosus armatus;organism;PG10051;9;but then there came a clang and clamor of sound on the other side, and voices called out to him as comrade, as lover, as friend, and reminded him of the delights which once had been so sweet to him, and of the freedom he loved, and boasted the right of man to seek what was pleasant and what was sweet, and flouted him as a coward whose aim was to save himself, and scorned him as a believer in old wives' tales and superstitions that men had outgrown.

sage;Salvia patens;organism;PG10051;9;she put her hand upon the arm of the sage and called to him, 'speak you, speak you!

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10051;18;he lay there, half in the light and half in the shadow, gripping the rocks with his hands, burrowing into the cool herbage above and the mountain flowers, clinging, catching hold, despairing, yet seizing everything he could grasp,--the tender grass, the rolling stones.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10051;19;he put out his hand to it, and touched the ground that was golden with those heavenly rays, and gathered himself up till he felt it upon his face, and opened wide his dazzled eyes, then shaded them with trembling hands, and said to himself, 'it is the sun, it is the sun!'

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10051;20;for when the eyes are used to the darkness, the horror of the gloom was no longer like a solid thing, but moved into shades of darker and less dark, so that she saw where the rocks stood, and how they sank with edges that cut like swords down and ever down into the abysses, and how here a deep ravine was rent between them, and there were breaks and scars as though some one had caught the jagged points with wounded hand or foot, struggling up the perpendicular surface towards the little ray of light, like a tiny star which shone as on immeasurable heights to show where life was.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10051;20;as she travelled deeper and deeper, it was a wonder to see how far that little ray penetrated down and down through gulfs of darkness, blue and cold like the shimmer of a diamond, and even when it could be seen no more, sent yet a shadowy refraction, a line of something less black than the darkness, a lightening amid the gloom, a something indefinable which was hope.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;34;i might have flung myself upon a bed of hot ashes, so much was it unlike the dewy cool earth which i expected, upon which one can always throw one's self with a sensation of repose.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;37;i had strength enough, however,for i cared not for the gold,, to fling myself back the other way upon the ground, where i rolled backwards, downwards, i knew not how, turning over and over upon sharp ashes and metallic edges, which tore my hair and beard.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;37;i had sense to lie still among the ashes thrown up out of the pit, while i heard their voices.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10051;37;the glitter of a lantern flashed in my eyes, a foot passed, crashing among the ashes so close to my cheek that the shoe grazed it.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10052;1;the village of brentwood lay almost under the house, on the other side of the deep little ravine, down which a stream--which ought to have been a lovely, wild, and frolicsome little river--flowed between its rocks and trees.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10052;1;our side of the dell was charmingly accidente , and clothed with fine trees, through which various paths wound down to the river-side and to the village bridge which crossed the stream.

ivy;Hedera helix;organism;PG10052;2;the old building had the remains of a tower,--an indistinguishable mass of mason-work, over-grown with ivy, and the shells of walls attached to this were half filled up with soil.

bramble;Rubus plicatus;organism;PG10052;2;there was a large room, or what had been a large room, with the lower part of the windows still existing, on the principal floor, and underneath other windows, which were perfect, though half filled up with fallen soil, and waving with a wild growth of brambles and chance growths of all kinds.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;3;the horses seemed to me to creep along the long dark country road.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10052;3;as we dashed through the park, i thought i heard some one moaning among the trees, and clenched my fist at him,whoever he might be,with fury.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;3;the horses flew like lightning along the intervening path, and drew up at the door all panting, as if they had run a race.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;4;and i replied, when i could find my voice, also in a whisper, as though the jingling of the horses' furniture and the sound of their hoofs must not have been more dangerous.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;4;i stood on the steps with her a moment, almost afraid to go in, now that i was here, and it seemed to me that i saw without observing, if i may say so, that the horses were unwilling to turn round, though their stables lay that way, or that the men were unwilling.

owl;Strigiformes;organism;PG10052;13;the contrast between it and the hoot of the owl was indescribable,--the one with a wholesome wildness and naturalness that hurt nobody, the other, a sound that made one's blood curdle, full of human misery.

ivy;Hedera helix;organism;PG10052;13;the light showed the bit of wall, the ivy glistening upon it in clouds of dark green, the bramble-branches waving, and below, the open door,--a door that led to nothing.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;15;"you've got an epidemic in your house, colonel," simson said to me next morning.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;15;upon this he laughed aloud, then said, "that's not such a bad idea, but it would ruin me forever if it were known that john simson was ghost-hunting."

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;16;that night at eleven i met simson at the gate.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10052;16;all was silent as a winter night could be,--so silent that we heard far off the sound of the horses in the stables, the shutting of a window at the house.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;16;simson lighted his taper and went peering about, poking into all the corners.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;16;dr. simson did nothing but utter subdued laughs under his breath.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;17;simson had been a little startled by the first sound.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;17;i listened almost without any emotion at all in my own person, thinking of its effect upon simson.

holly;Ilex;organism;PG10052;17;all that coming and going of the voice was, if our ears could be trusted, exactly in front of the vacant, blank door-way, blazing full of light, which caught and shone in the glistening leaves of the great hollies at a little distance.

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10052;17;not a rabbit could have crossed the turf without being seen, but there was nothing.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;17;after a time, simson, with a certain caution and bodily reluctance, as it seemed to me, went out with his roll of taper into this space.

holly;Ilex;organism;PG10052;17;his figure showed against the holly in full outline.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;17;simson recoiled violently, as if some one had come up against him, then turned, and held his taper low, as if examining something.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;18;next morning simson was out before breakfast, and came in with evident signs of the damp grass on his boots, and a look of worry and weariness, which did not say much for the night he had passed.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;18;and i told him the story,--more than i had told simson.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;19;this gave me a little comfort,--more than simson had given me.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10052;19;the road to the station and the village lay through the glen, not by the ruins, but though the sunshine and the fresh air, and the beauty of the trees, and the sound of the water were all very soothing to the spirits, my mind was so full of my own subject that i could not refrain from turning to the right hand as i got to the top of the glen, and going straight to the place which i may call the scene of all my thoughts.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;20;simson came out to dinner, and when the house was all still, and most of the servants in bed, we went out and met dr. moncrieff, as we had appointed, at the head of the glen.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;20;simson, for his part, was disposed to scoff at the doctor.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;20;"if it's the same to you," i said, "i wish you'd keep all that to yourself, simson.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;20;simson placed himself on the side next the ruins, so as to intercept any communication with the old house, which was what his mind was fixed upon.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10052;21;dr. moncrieff's lantern, which was a large one, without any means of shutting up,--an old-fashioned lantern with a pierced and ornamental top,--shone steadily, the rays shooting out of it upward into the gloom.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;21;i declare that it seemed to me as if i were pushed against, put aside, by the owner of the voice as he paced up and down in his trouble,--though these are perfectly futile words, seeing that the stream of light from my lantern, and that from simson's taper, lay broad and clear, without a shadow, without the smallest break, across the entire breadth of the grass.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;21;but the minister resumed, without seeing simson, speaking to some one else.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;22;simson all the time stood in the door-way, with an expression in his face such as words could not tell, his under lip dropped, his eyes wild, staring.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;22;simson held out his hand to me to help me up.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10052;22;moncrieff himself was the first to speak.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;23;but simson, who turned with us, and who had gone along all this time with his taper flaring, in entire unconsciousness, came to himself, apparently at the sound of our voices, and put out that wild little torch with a quick movement, as if of shame.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;23;i think if simson had begun again to me with his questions, i should have pitched him over the rocks as we returned up the glen, but he was silent, by a good inspiration.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;24;i did not ask, as simson did, how he recognized him.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;24;i must add one curious fact, which does not seem to me to have any relation to the above, but which simson made great use of, as the human agency which he was determined to find somehow.

simson;Senecio vulgaris;organism;PG10052;24;we had examined the ruins very closely at the time of these occurrences, but afterwards, when all was over, as we went casually about them one sunday afternoon in the idleness of that unemployed day, simson with his stick penetrated an old window which had been entirely blocked up with fallen soil.

ivy;Hedera helix;organism;PG10052;24;there we found a little hole,--for it was more a hole than a room,--entirely hidden under the ivy and ruins, in which there was a quantity of straw laid in a corner, as if some one had made a bed there, and some remains of crusts about the floor.

holly;Ilex;organism;PG10062;17;all warchester poured out to the holly hills, and when at five o'clock the companies filed out on the shining green there was such a cheer that the men felt repaid for the tiresome wait of months.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10062;17;there was a throb of passionate joy in the ranks when this eulogium reached the men, for the words were hardly spoken when they were known in every company by that mysterious telegraphy which makes the human body a conductor swift as an electric wire among large masses of men.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;jack, to whom the manual was a very sacred thing, broke into fierce ridicule of the commander, declaring that he was better fitted for sutler than colonel.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;now this chance threw wesley boone out, and there was great rejoicing in the acredale group, who hoped that this stroke of luck would make place for their favorite, jack sprague.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;jack was urged by the major of the regiment, who had gone with the five hundred, to cast his fortunes with the new body, promising a speedy lieutenancy.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;but jack would not desert the caribees.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;jack, of course, refused to take part in these scenic rallies, making known his sentiments in vehement disdain.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;he detested oswald, who had quit his party, not on a question of principle, but merely for place, and jack did not spare him in his satirical allusions to the new uses invented for the military.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;a still more trying injustice befell the luckless jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;one evening when it was known that orders had come for the regiment to march, jack, having formed the company for parade, received a paper from the captain's orderly to read.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;jack read the monstrous wrong without a tremor.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;many of them were jack's classmates.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;18;but, as is often the case with impetuous, hot-headed spirits, jack cooled as his friends grew hot.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;19;they "dressed up" sullenly as jack called the roll for the last time, and received trask, the new orderly, at a "present," which, though not in the tactics, jack exacted as a penitence for the momentary revolt.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;19;he was so confused that jack, from the flank, was obliged to repeat the few commands needed to get the company to the field.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;19;jack, in a cluster of his town cronies, caught sight of his mother at one of the windows of the parthenon hotel.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;19;"jack, what have you in your knapsack?

saratoga;Scleropages leichardti;organism;PG10062;19;it is harder to manage than a saratoga trunk.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;19;she bent over while barney moore, one of jack's acredale comrades, gallantly loosed the straps.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;19;she searched carefully through the divers articles, taking everything out, jack looking on ruefully while his companions gathered about in vague curiosity.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10062;19;she searched carefully through the divers articles, taking everything out, jack looking on ruefully while his companions gathered about in vague curiosity.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;19;there was a great shout of laughter as the fun of the incident flashed upon the listeners, many of whom had heard the ingenuous jack often in other days sighing for war, and the chance that napoleon said every man had of finding a marshal's baton in his knapsack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;19;jack bore the banter very equably, knowing that olympia was rather striving to keep his spirits up and divert him from the tears in his mother's eyes than indulge her own humor.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;20;jack was all eyes and ears for the spectacle the country presented.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;20;indeed, as the observant jack afterward learned, it was part of the plan of the groups that first began to create great fortunes during the war to make the soldiers pay for their rations en route to the seat of war, or depend upon the charity of citizens along the railway lines.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;20;most of the men in jack's company, at least, were gently nurtured, but the steaming oysters, cold beef, and generous "chunks" of bread, filled their eyes with a magnificence and their stomachs with a gentle repletion no banquet before or after ever equaled.

oyster;Ostreidae;organism;PG10062;20;most of the men in jack's company, at least, were gently nurtured, but the steaming oysters, cold beef, and generous "chunks" of bread, filled their eyes with a magnificence and their stomachs with a gentle repletion no banquet before or after ever equaled.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;21;jack and his crony, barney moore, studied the scene in wonder.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;21;jack said, as the crowd of brigadiers thickened before the hotel door.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;21;"oh, come now, jack, these stars are really dazzling you!"

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;21;but barney's astral jokes were brought to a period by the sharp note of the bugle, as colonel oswald, very important under the eye of so many big-wigs, magnificently ordered the march.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;22;"it makes a fellow feel as godfrey's hosts felt when they came in sight of the bosporus, and the hordes of the saracens on the plains of the hellespont," jack said, exultingly, as barney stood on a pile of camp equipages above him, surveying the quickening spectacle.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;22;"i don't know how godfrey's fellows felt, jack, but it do make a man feel kinder able to do something with so many near by to lend a hand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;22;fair and square, now, jack, you feel the fires of military genius in your big head--do you think that you could disentangle this enormous coil--put each corps, division, and regiment, in its proper place--at a day's notice?"

drill;Mandrillus leucophaeus;organism;PG10062;22;order is the first law of the soldier as well as of heaven, and many a careless lad brought from his four years' drill method and painstaking that made him of more value to himself and his neighbors.

drill;Mandrillus leucophaeus;organism;PG10062;22;it was fully a week before the caribees were installed ready for sunday inspection, as no exigency was permitted to interfere with morning and afternoon drill, guard-mount, and parade.

drill;Mandrillus leucophaeus;organism;PG10062;22;battalion and brigade drill, too, were new diversions for the caribees, as now, camped near other troops, these more complicated movements were part of the regiment's allotted duty.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23;one day jack and barney, walking in fifteenth street, saw a stout man, with no insignia to indicate rank or station, coming out of the headquarters hurriedly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23;noticing the two lads, he came to where jack was standing in a preoccupied way, and the two saluted decorously.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23;he gave jack an envelope and hurried back into the building as the two lads started with alacrity across the street.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23;the war department was easy of access, an old building not unlike jack's own home in acredale.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23;the man looked at it, pointed to a closed door, and jack, receiving no response to his knock, entered.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23;but the figure that fixed jack's reverential attention was half sprawling, half lying over the heaped-up impediments of the big desk.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23;without a word jack handed him the envelope, and with a sort of reverence to the tall figure whose face was turned kindly toward him he backed to the door.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;23;but jack's good fortune was the talk of the regiment for many a day, and for months when the fellows of the caribee got leave they lingered expectantly about the modest headquarters, hoping that a missing orderly might bring them jack sprague's proud distinction of seeing the president face to face.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;23;on the grand review, a few days later, jack and his crony were reminded of the encounter at headquarters, for the man who had given the envelope to carry to the war office was riding a splendid horse next to the president.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;24;jack and his acredale squad, as the college fellows were called, lived in a perpetual dream, from which the hard realities of drill, now six hours a day, could not waken them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;24;jack was filled with dire fears that the commanding officer, having discovered the incompetency of oswald, feared to take the caribees to the front.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;24;in the secrecy of jack's tent, however, the subject was freely discussed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;24;bernard moore--barney, for short--was to be a physician, and had already passed an apprenticeship in a pharmacy, coincident with his college term in jack's class.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;25;"on the double crown on your head," jack answered, solemnly, "which you have often told us was considered a sign that an angel had touched you--i'm sure nothing could be more solemn than that.

buttercup;Ranunculus;organism;PG10062;25;"there isn't enough poetry or sentiment in the two o' ye to fill a wind-blown buttercup.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;25;you remind me of two school-girls," jack remonstrated, as in duty bound to keep up the warrior spirit.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;26;neither jack nor nick marsh dared trust himself to meet the other's eyes as the helpless chief disappeared down the hillside, while barney entered into an exhaustive treatise on the symptoms of cholera and the liability of the most robust to meet sudden disaster in this malarious upland, circumvailated by ages of decaying matter in the damp swamps on every hand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;26;but when, an hour later, company k's whole street was aroused by peal on peal of abderian laughter, jack and nick were found helpless in their bunks, and barney was engaged in presenting a potion to settle their collapsed nerves!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;26;in the agony of all this jack, returning from a

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;26;his gun was on his arm and his knapsack on his back, but only the realization that a score of eyes were upon him saved jack from dropping limply on the ground, as, looking in the group, he saw dick perley and tom twigg grinning ingratiatingly at him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;26;jack waited until the rest were scattered, and then, leading the boys aside, said, sternly,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;appalled by jack's stern manner as much as by his words, the two lads began to whimper and expostulate tearfully.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;perley was eighteen in april last, and he was a soldier in spite of all that jack could do.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;jack was deeply perplexed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;jack asked, doubtingly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;"yes," dick said, noting with boyish quickness the indecision in jack's troubled face.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;the astute young rascal had hit upon the weak place, and jack stood in anxious doubt wondering what to do.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;an aide that he recognized from division headquarters rode past at the moment and jack turned to watch him.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;27;he leaped from his horse at the colonel's tent.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;jack again looked at the boys.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;as he reached it the major, mcgoyle, was entering, and jack waited until that officer should come out.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;jack saluted, and stated his dilemma to the commander, who listened with amused interest.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;"i don't see that anything can be done now, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;jack's relief and gratitude were best seen in the brightening eye and the more buoyant movement that succeeded the heaviness and agitation of his first impression.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;27;jack explained something of this to the young marlboroughs, and was fairly irritated at the crest-fallen look that came into their eager, shining faces when they comprehended that they were not to be with their hero.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;28;the very possibility of being sent into some unknown regiment was a terror so great that the other alternative became less odious to the boys, and they trotted after jack, as he stalked moody and distracted to major mike mcgoyle's tent, now the only habitable spot left where a few hours before a symmetrical little city had stood.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;28;it was impossible for jack to sustain the role of frowning displeasure as dick skipped back with him to the company.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;28;jack, through colonel grandison, knew that general mcdowell and the commander-in-chief, the venerable soldier scott, had pleaded and protested against a move until the new levies under the three-months' call could be drilled and disciplined.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10062;28;some regiments had raw flour dealt them for rations and no bake-ovens to turn it into bread, some regiments had abundance of bread, but no coffee or meat rations.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;29;eager as jack and his friends were to note the impression the march made upon the civilians, most of whom were thought to be secretly in sympathy with the rebellion, it was impossible to even catch sight of any but soldiers.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;29;on the bridge they looked eagerly down the river, where the low roofs of alexandria were visible, and upward on the virginia shore where the gleaming walls of arlington recalled to jack far different times and scenes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;29;"but now we are on the 'sacred soil,'" jack cries, as the company debouched from the bridge up the steep, narrow road that seemed to be taking them to arlington.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;29;there wasn't a man in the company that didn't resent the fact, constantly obtruding itself on the ranks as they marched eagerly onward by every knoll, every bush in the landscape, that union soldiers had been there before them!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;30;"jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;30;barney read one or two phrases of his composition to the indulgent ear of jack and the poet, over which they laughed a good deal.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;30;dick perley listened in awe to jack's wonderful ratiocinations on what was to come--secretly believing him much more learned in war than this general mcdowell who was commanding the army.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;30;the first bugle sounded at three in the morning in the caribees' camp, and when the coffee had been hastily dispatched, the men began to understand the cause of their being shunted into the field so early the evening before while the rear of the column marched ahead of them.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10062;30;the company was spread out in groups of four, these again were separated by a few yards, and in this order, sweeping like a drag-net, they advanced over the dry fields, through the clustering pines or into cultivated acres, and through great farm-yards.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;30;here and there the skirmishers--for that was the office the two companies were now filling--came upon signs of picket-posts, and once, as jack hurried beyond his group to the thicket, near a wretched cabin, a horse and rider were visible tearing through the foliage of a winding lane.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;30;he drew up his musket in prompt recognition of his duty, but he saw with mortification that the horse and rider continued unharmed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;30;other shots from the skirmish-line followed, but jack's rebel was the only enemy seen, when, in the early dusk, an orderly from the main column brought the command to set pickets and bivouac for the night.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;30;jack would have written with better grounds for his solemnity if he had waited until this evening, but now there was no chance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;31;jack smiled wisely over these amateur guesses, and quite abashed the rest when he said,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;31;we've got fifty thousand men, or thereabout",jack was wrong, there were but thirty thousand,.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;31;"goodness, jack, you ought to have been commander-in-chief!

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;31;the war-talk went on late into the night, for the company, detached from camp, was not obliged to follow the signals of the bugles that came in melodious echoes over the fragrant fields.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10062;31;"the assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold."

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;31;then the bugle sounded a halt.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;31;the bugle sounds forward!

nettle;Urtica;organism;PG10062;32;but now they are at the foot of the hill--though it is not correct to so call it, for it was a long, winding valley, through which ran a dancing streamlet, very welcome to the thirsty warriors when they had succeeded in breaking through the vicious natural chevaux de frise of blackberry-briers and nettles.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;32;the bullets had begun to come regularly, and suddenly, as jack conducted his squad across the stream, he was startled by the exclamation, uttered rather in reverence, it seemed to him, than surprise or pain,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;32;jack ran and lifted him out, but even before the hospital corps came the boy was dead.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;32;jack shouted to the squad just ahead of him--"surrender, or we'll blow your heads off!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;32;jack's squad sent back twenty-three prisoners to major mike, who took them in proud triumph to general tyler, riding with the head of the column, now that the tenacity of the rebel skirmishers made it seem probable that there would be serious work.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;32;at dusk the bugles, moving with the captains in the rear, sounded the rally, and then the scattered groups came together in company.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10062;32;companies k and h were so beset that they forgot to boil their coffee, and would have gone thirsty to their dewy beds, if the other companies' cooks had not shared their rations with the gossiping heroes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;32;but tom twigg, who had been with the major at headquarters, explained to jack that the army was divided into three bodies of about ten thousand men each, and that tyler's column, of which the caribees were the advance, were the extreme northern body, that they were now at vienna, far north of manassas, where schenck had been beset a month before in his never-enough-ridiculed reconnaissance by train, that in the morning they were to push on to fairfax court-house and thence to centreville, where the army was to come together for the blow at the rebels.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;32;jack and his friends were a good deal chagrined to learn that they were not as near the enemy as the column to the south of them, whose fires had been mistaken for beauregard's.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;33;though not given the skirmish-line next day--the 17th--jack was delighted to find that the caribees led all the rest.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;33;often, in after-days--when sherman had become the turenne of the armies--jack, who was often heard to brag of his gift of detecting greatness, used to turn very red in the face when he was reminded of a saying of his on that hot july day,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;33;"the shenandoah," jack said, mopping the dust, or rather the thin coating of mud, from his face and brow, for the perspiration, oozing at every pore, naturally covered the exposed skin with an unpremeditated cosmetic.

hamlet;Hypoplectrus;organism;PG10062;33;the march to fairfax court-house, for which judicial temple the curious soldier looked in vain, was but eight miles from the point of departure in the morning, but it was two o'clock in the afternoon when the caribees passed the hamlet, turning sharply to the right.

hamlet;Hypoplectrus;organism;PG10062;33;there was no provost guard to spur on the stragglers, and when, late in the afternoon, the way-worn columns spread themselves on the western slope of the hamlet of centreville, at least a third of each regiment was far in the rear.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;33;mother earth must have ministered to the weary flesh, for at sunrise, when the music of the bugles aroused them, they started up with the alert vivacity of old campaigners.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10062;33;while the reinvigorated ranks were at coffee, there was a great clatter in the rear, and presently a cortege of mounted officers appeared, general mcdowell among them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;34;jack had provided himself with a field-glass.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;34;the general, too, was examining the distant lines, and jack took it as a good omen that sherman grew jocose and appeared to be making merry with tyler, whose face looked troubled, now that the decisive moment seemed at hand.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10062;34;such a country as the march led into, no one had ever seen in the north outside of mountain regions--deep gullies, wastes of gnarled and aggressive oaks, that tore clothes and flesh in the passage, sudden hillocks rising conical and inconsequent every few rods, deep chasms conducting driblets of water, morasses covered with dark and stagnant pools, where the pioneers fairly picked their steps among squirming reptiles.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;34;the cavalry was forced to hold the narrow wood road, as the bush was hardly passable for men.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;35;looking to left and right, jack can see the colors of three regiments, and his eye rests with pleasure on the bright, shining folds of the caribees' dark-blue state flag spread to the breeze beside the stars of the union.

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10062;35;evidently, for the command is still "forward, bear center, bear right."

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10062;35;then, square in front, where the thick, broad leaves of the oak glitter in the sun, there is seen a cylinder of steam-like smoke, with fiery gleams at the end, a crackling explosion of a hogshead of fire-crackers, then a rushing, screaming sound in their very faces, then a few rods behind a ringing, vicious explosion.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;35;jack's comrade held this conversation with one of the prisoners,

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;35;they had to cut the trees down, yonder, to get room for 'em."

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10062;35;you can have some coffee if the guards will let you make it."

snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10062;36;i tell you what it is, yank, you'll see snakes right soon, for our folks are behind you."

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10062;36;a hundred yards nearly below the water-course was fringed with thick copses of oak, and the gently ascending slopes on the western bank were completely hidden from the union lines.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;36;a few gaunt, almost limbless trees rose up spectrally on the ridge, offering the compact masses neither shelter from the sun nor security from the enemy--if there were an enemy near.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;36;dick came up to jack out of breath with great news, just as the caribees were aligning themselves to move forward.

sharpshooter;Proconiini;organism;PG10062;36;the rebel sharpshooters, hurrying to the flank, poured in hurtling, murderous volleys, filling the minds of the panic-stricken mob with the idea, the most awful that can enter a soldier's mind, that his line is surrounded.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;36;poor jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;37;late at night dick came down to jack's bivouac with a strange tale.

plant;Plantae;organism;PG10062;37;i tell you the great man of this war is the man that plants the flag at manassas, and i'm going through to richmond to-night."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;37;jack cried, thinking of the disgrace of the day before and of the small chance the regiment had under such a chief to redeem its prestige on the morrow.

yellow flag;Iris pseudacorus;organism;PG10062;37;the yellow flag floated from an immense tent near the roadway.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;38;jack was provided with a large atlas map of virginia, and with the bits of information given by dick he was able to conjecture the probable plan of the next day.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;38;nick asked, absorbed in jack's confident predications.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;38;jack was sergeant of the guard that night, and it was in the group of sentries awaiting their relief every two hours, re-enforced by his tent-mates of company k, that these learned dissertations on war were carried on.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;39;"ah ha, jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;39;"wait," jack cried, owlishly.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;39;the rebels, behind a thick screen of trees, took up the challenge, and every sound was drowned in the roar of the artillery.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;39;"ah ha, jack, frederick's on the other side, eh?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;39;jack, going forward with his glass, noticed an officer among the men, but not catching sight of his face did not recognize him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;39;jack took his glass to discover, but the rider had disappeared.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;39;an instant after from a knoll, jack, glass at eye, was examining eagerly the field on the other side of the river, when a horseman suddenly shot into view, riding desperately.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;39;jack said, excitedly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;39;jack said, excitedly.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;39;jack said, excitedly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;39;jack turned, the officer was at his shoulder.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;39;he turned to an orderly that was following at a distance leading a horse.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;40;sherman was eying every inch of the bank until, suddenly reaching a break where fresh tracks of a horse were visible, he directed his orderly to follow, and plunged into the water.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;40;it was not up to the horses' knees from bank to bank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;40;then, addressing jack, he said,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;40;glowing, grateful, big with the fate of the battle, jack had barney, nick, and another, whom he charged with the duty of historian, detailed for this duty of glory.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10062;40;the group set off with a fervent godspeed from the company sheltered among the thick pines and oaks.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10062;40;the group set off with a fervent godspeed from the company sheltered among the thick pines and oaks.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;40;"now, boys," jack said, every inch the captain, "we must spread out like skirmishers.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;40;jack looked at his watch.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;40;at the end of a half-hour the bullets and shells passed over the group as jack and his squad pushed along the hilly way.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;40;twice, commands, and even the clicking, of what jack knew must be rebel guns sounded not twenty paces away, but, thanks to the thick bushes, the scouts passed unseen, and, thanks to the noise of battle, unheard.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;40;"o jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;41;"best a few minutes," jack said, soothingly.

sycamore;Acer pseudoplatanus;organism;PG10062;41;stripping off his accoutrements, he clasped a tall sycamore growing at the crest of the ravine, and when far up brought his glass to bear.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;41;then through the veil of smoke long, deep masses of blue emerge and make for the rebel front on the brow of the hill, fairly at jack's feet, the enemy redoubles the fire, two guns at their left pour canister into the advancing wall of blue.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;41;jack feels like flying.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;41;he almost falls from the tree in his excitement.

palmetto;Sabal;organism;PG10062;41;loud cheers in the trees back of the rebels, far to the southeast, perhaps a mile and a half, then the flaunting palmetto flag flying forward in the center of deep masses of gray.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;41;at a deep branch of the stream the three rearmost came in sight of jack, up to his armpits in water and pushing for the shore.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;41;while they are hailing him exultantly he sinks out of sight, an awful anguish almost stops the others, but barney, flinging his musket and impediments off as he runs, leaps far into the stream, and when the rest reach the spot he has jack by the hair, dragging him to the bank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;41;barney takes out his handkerchief and puts it on his gun, which he was careful to go back and recover when jack was on the bank.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10062;41;a ray of bright red suddenly flits above the thick tops of the scrub-oaks.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;41;to him jack makes known sherman's message, and is directed farther to the southwest, the union right now facing nearly to the east in the execution of mcdowell's admirable flank manoeuvre.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;42;but jack is easy on the score of his mission, since the general, who is nearest the stone bridge, has been apprised, and well knows that the fire which has been coming near his left flank is sherman's.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;42;until, however, he has executed his orders literally jack won't be satisfied, and plunges on, the others following, nothing loath.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;42;the air is filled with moaning men, whinnying horses, the hurried movement of stretchers, the solemn solicitude of the hospital corps.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;42;jack says, addressing an officer with a star.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;42;jack gave his message, and franklin said, cheerfully,"that's good news.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10062;42;here and there clumps of tall pines stand in the bare, brown sod as if to guard the young outshoots clustering about them in wanton dispersion.

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10062;42;the remnants of rail fences strew the ground here and there.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;42;against the stout bodies of the trees, armless men, legless trunks, the maimed in every condition of death's fantastic sport, hold themselves limply erect, to gain succor or save some of the vital stream pouring from their gaping wounds.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;42;then behind, through the gaps in the trees, big, whining, screeching swarms of another caliber shells fly over the wall of blue.

hydra;Hydra;organism;PG10062;43;the thirteen cannon behind the struggling hydra of gray seem one vortex--sulphurous, flaming, spitting, as from one vast mouth, scorching fire, huge mouthfuls of granite venom.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;43;all this jack sees, and he turns heartsick from the sight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;43;when the straggling couriers reached the point designated as mcdowell's headquarters, he had gone to the eastward of the line, and, faithful to the command given him, jack set out with barney, leaving the others to deliver the message in case he missed the general.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;43;jack climbed a tall oak to reconnoitre the ground for mcdowell, but, as his glass revealed the battling lines, he shouted to barney to climb for a moment, to impress the frightful yet grandiose spectacle upon his mind.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;43;in twenty minutes more, at the same rate, the hill upon which the rebel lines nearest the tree held the union right at bay would be surrounded on two sides.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;43;through the glass jack could see the lines clearly--or the smoke arising above them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;44;they are moving on the right point of the crescent, and unless the union commander is alert they will break in on the back of the point, for jack, without knowing it, was virtually in the rebel lines--that is, he was nearer the rebel left flank, the foot of the long, bow-shaped staircase, than he was to the tip of the union crescent.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;44;jack is trembling--demoniac.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;44;the blue mass reappears, they come with a wild rush in well-ordered array, they are the regulars, jack can tell by their movements.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;44;the blue vanish into the thick bushes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;44;another irruption, another pall of smoke, and jack's heart bounds in exultant joy, for he sees the new york flag in the van.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;44;the southern lines are longer than the northern, but they have been since the first moment jack got a glimpse of them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;45;as jack looks down in the narrow way between the hill he is on and the plateau on the very edge of the union line--in fact, behind it now, for it has moved forward since he took post--a rushing mass of gray-clad soldiery is moving forward on the dead run.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;45;he climbs down in haste and discovers his comrade soundly sleeping against the base of the tree.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;45;reaching his perch again, jack cast his despairing eyes toward the fatal hill.

perch;Percinae;organism;PG10062;45;reaching his perch again, jack cast his despairing eyes toward the fatal hill.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;45;his last despairing glance caught a body of jet black horses galloping wildly into the dispersing ranks of blue.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;45;he came down from the tree limp, nerveless, unmanned.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;45;then, with swift movement, always as near the thick bushes as they could push, they fled faster and faster, as fear fell more and more heavily upon their quickened fancies.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;45;they can see the turnpike far beyond the stone bridge half-way to centreville,they see crowds fleeing in zigzag lines over the open fields, see horses plunging wildly, laden down by two and even three men on their backs, they see vehicles overturned at the roadside, whence the horses have been cut or killed by the rebel shells, they see an army, in every sense a mob, swarming behind the deserted rebel forts, they see orderly ranks of shining black horses this side the stone bridge charging the fleeing lines of blue, they see shells whirling like huge blackbirds in the sky, suddenly falling among the skurrying thousands, they see a shell finally burst on the bridge, shiver a caisson to fragments, and then all sign of organized flight comes to an end.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;46;never music sounded sweeter in jack's car than that jaunty epithet

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;46;now they were traversing slowly the very ground jack and his comrades had flown over in the morning.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;46;still firing--still working with all his heart in the deadly play, jack sidles to the officer and cries out,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;46;"there, keep to the left sharp, and we shall come to a deep gully where the water is only knee-deep," jack cries, also replenishing his cartridge-box, which had shrunk under the rapid work of the last half-hour.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;46;jack explained his mission, and the officer, who had been dealing out the timely windfall of ammunition, nodded.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;46;now jack understood the mysterious legions that seemed to spring from the earth.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;47;jack turned, he was near the captain, and he marked, with deadly panic, a look of despair settle down on the heroic, handsome face.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;47;jack handed him his own glass--the captain had none.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;47;"with all my heart," jack cried, heartily.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;47;for answer jack raised the pistol in his hand and fired.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;47;he fired the shots as agreed upon, firing two at the group marching heedlessly forward, as the skirmish-line was far ahead, or they supposed it was, for the two men disabled by jack and barney were the advance, as it was not supposed that any but stragglers were near at hand, and the company were returning to their regiment.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;47;he looks where jack had been and sees him lying on the ground, stifling an agonized cry by holding his left arm over his mouth.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;47;barney might have escaped, at least he might have delayed capture, but coming from behind the tree, he holds up his hands, and flinging himself on the ground beside his comrade takes his head upon his knee and awaits the worst.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;49;an officer,the hero whom jack had so much admired, and who turned out to be gouverneur k. warren,had escaped from the forlorn hope left to dispute the rebel charge upon the flying columns.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;51;indeed, jack's detail by colonel sherman had effectually cut off all trace of his movements after the battle began.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;51;the music of the bugles aroused them at sunrise--a wan, haggard group, sad-eyed and silent.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;52;"this," the orderly said, pointing to a small stone building in a bare and ragged waste of trees, shrubs, and ruined implements of war, "is the henry house--what is left of it--the key of our position when jackson formed his stone wall facing toward the northwest, over there where your folks very cleverly flanked us and waited an hour or two, heaven only knows what for, unless it was to give us time to bring up our re-enforcements.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;52;your officers lay the blame on burnside and hunter, who, they declare, just sat still half the day, while sherman got in behind us and would have captured every man jack of our fellows, if johnston hadn't come up, where i showed you, in the very nick of time."

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;52;it was still as on the day of the battle, save that instead of the thousands of beating hearts, the flaunting flags, and roaring guns, there were countless ridges torn in the sod, as if a plow had run through at random, limbs and trees torn down and whirled across each other, broken wheels, musket stocks and barrels, twisted and sticking, gaunt and eloquent, in the tough, grassy fiber of the earth.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;52;we were driven from the broad, smooth road yonder that you see cutting through the trees, northward a mile from here.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;53;olympia commented, thinking that, after all, jack might not have been hit.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;53;the ambulance drove on into the warrenton pike, and, if olympia had known it, within a stone's-throw of jack's last effort, where the cavalry picket came upon him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;54;he could bring official intervention to bear, without which jack might, even though alive and well, be hidden from them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;55;when jack, the day after the battle, found himself able to take account of what was going on, he closed his eyes again with a deep groan, believing in a vague glimpse of peaceful rest that his last confused sensation was real--that he was dead.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;56;jack instantly suspected the situation, the conversation in the ambulance coming back to him now distinctly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;56;jack was not familiar with the rebel insignia, and could not discover his rank or service, but he expected to hear himself denounced as a spy or anything odious.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;57;jack's eyes were so bright when mrs. raines looked at him, as she lowered the sheet, that she arose, exclaiming quickly,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;57;she moved precipitately from the room, and jack sank back with a groan.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;58;jack almost laughed now, as the dialogue in the ambulance recurred to him, and the adroit use the men had made of their unconscious charges to secure a furlough.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;58;jack could scarcely keep a serious face, as this humorous lament displayed the pride of the dominion and the unconscious boeotianism of the provincial.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;58;so, after a friendly talk in which the poor lady cried a great deal and besought jack's good-will for her darling william, if ever he were luckless enough to be captured, the note was written and dispatched to the atterburys, whose city house was near the capital square.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;59;jack said nothing, his mind was on his mother and the misery she must be enduring.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;59;even the doctor, calling about nine o'clock, was sent away on some pretext, and the poor lady waited with an anxiety, almost as poignant as jack's own, for the response to his note.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;59;mrs. raines went to the door herself, not daring to trust the colored girl, who had lavished untold pains on jack's linen and the manual part of his care.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;59;jack heard low voices in the hallway, then on the stairs, and he knew some one had come.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;59;jack said, smiling at a pair of the brownest and most bewitching eyes fixed soberly on him.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;59;he--vin--had three horses killed, and was made a major on the field by general joe johnston.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;60;"carcassonne," jack murmured.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;60;"since you slept most of the way you must have dreamed the beauty, as you certainly have invented the tyrant," rosa retorted, as the brawny servants lifted jack bodily and carried him up the three steps and into the sitting-room.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;60;but jack's letter was never sent, for when the post came from richmond the next day, vincent read in the morning paper a surprising personal item,

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10062;61;fortunately at the instant there is a blast from the bugles--"fall in!"

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;61;and the men rush to their horses.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;61;jack had been traced to porter's lines, then far to the left, where nick had been told to wait.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;61;he told of jack's persistent valor to the last, and the dreadful moment, when he, jack, had been separated.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;62;he had come to company k after jack had been sent out on the skirmish-line.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;62;when he reached the place indicated he learned of jack's detail to the extreme right of the army.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;62;he ran back in the bushes, out of sight, and then by a detour struck the stream far above to the right.

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10062;63;but the men didn't want to die at their posts, or anywhere else, but made off like frightened rabbits.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;63;i had no trouble in stepping out, and then i pushed on in jack's direction.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;63;i came upon nick marsh near the general's headquarters, and he told me the direction the others had gone, but urged me to remain with him--as jack would surely be back there, horsemen having ridden out in that direction to relieve him.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;63;"there i had to lie in the bushes, for two columns of troops were coming and going, the flying fellows that sherman had routed near the stone bridge and the re-enforcements that were tearing up from the manassas railway.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;63;he was riding a splendid gray horse, and as the men broke into shouts he raised his hat and bowed right and left.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;63;there were long trains of wounded filing down the road, and men without guns, knapsacks, or side-arms, breaking through the bushes on all sides.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;63;"with this he put spurs to his horse, and the squadron halted on the road set off at a wild gallop.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;64;it seemed to clip the leaves from the trees, as i saw them cut, an hour or two before, by the swarming volleys of musketry.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;64;then the thought flashed into my head that if our army had been captured, my best chance of finding jack would be to follow to richmond and watch the blue-coats.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;64;but no one that i knew was among them, and i made up my mind that jack had escaped.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;64;well, i hung about the town, visiting all the places i thought it likely jack might be, and then i joined a cavalry company that belonged to early's brigade, at manassas.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;64;i was going there with them this morning to get back to our lines and find jack, when i saw the paragraph in the examiner , telling of your coming and whereabouts."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;64;"what a devoted boy, to risk his life and liberty for our poor jack!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;64;the carriage passed down the same road that jack had gone the day before, whistling sarcasms at his keeper.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10062;65;the air, tempered by the faint flavor of salt in the water, filled the travelers with an intoxicating vigor, lent strength to their jaded forces, which, while tense with expectation, could not wholly resist the delicious aroma, the lovely outlines of primeval forest, the melody of strange birds, startled along the shore by the wheezy puffing of the ferry.

sycamore;Acer pseudoplatanus;organism;PG10062;65;there were cries of admiring delight as the carriage ran from the long wooden pier into the dim arcade of sycamore and pine, through which the road wound, all the way to rosedale.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;65;"jack, jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;65;"jack's able to eat," rosa cried, darting down to embrace mrs. sprague, and starting with a little cry of wonder as aunt merry exclaimed, timidly,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;65;she said, welcoming the blushing youth cordially.,dick avowed afterward, in confidence to jack, that she would have kissed him if he hadn't held back, remembering his unkempt condition.,mamma and olympia were shown up to the door of jack's room, where rosalind very discreetly left them, to introduce the other guests to mrs. atterbury, attracted to the place by the unwonted sounds.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;65;when presently the visitors were shown into vincent's room, jack called out to them to come and see valor conquered by love, and, when they entered, mamma was brushing her eyes furtively, while she still held jack's unwounded hand under the counterpane.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;65;he established himself in jack's room, and no urging, prayer, or reproof could induce him to quit his hero's sight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;65;where he goes, i'm going, where he stays, i'll stay--sha'n't i, jack?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;65;but it hung heavily on jack's heart that no trace of barney had been found.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;65;"well, jack, this isn't much like the pomp and circumstance of glorious war," olympia cried, the next morning, coming in from an excursion about the "plantation," as she insisted on calling the estate, attended by merry, rosa, and dick.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;65;the roses are as large as sunflowers, and there are whole fields of them!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;66;"yes, every man jack of them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;66;"yes," jack said, unconsciously, "women enjoy crying--"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;66;the servant had moved the invalid's cot, where vincent could look in on jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;66;"i object, jack, to your generalization," olympia retorted.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;66;"it was the major in logic we were making free with," jack mumbled, laughing.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;66;jack asked, innocently.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;66;jack interjected, loftily.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;66;jack asked, looking at vincent.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;jack continued derisively.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;"come, jack, i won't listen to politics," olympia cried, with a warning look.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;"and you may be sure he will," jack added, softly, as though to himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;"but we've got far away from the crying and the babies," vincent began, when jack interrupted, fervently,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;jack added, slyly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;"i left all my blood to enrich your soil, or i'd blush," replied jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;"ah, jack, you're hit there!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;it's 'jack in the pulpit' that will spring from northern blood, and they'll preach such truths that the very herbage will bring the lesson of liberty and toleration to you."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;jack is as serious as we were at school when madame clarice told us of our sins."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;"jack was telling his, mamma, and that is still more serious than to hear one's own," vincent said, grinning at the moralist.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;mrs. atterbury addressed the question to olympia, making no account of jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;67;if the roads were not so rickety i wouldn't be afraid to set out now," jack answered.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;68;"this doesn't sound much like soldiering," jack said, dreamily.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;68;it suddenly occurred to jack that the poor fellow was masquerading as a rebel in the bosom of some eager patriot like mrs. raines and he reluctantly consented to let dick go to richmond to investigate.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;68;"it was he who came to our aid and ordered the rules to be broken that our mother might seek jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;68;we have accepted their hospitality, and we have made ourselves their guests," jack said, half seriously, as the young hotspur wrung his hand in a tearful embrace.

cattle;Bos taurus;organism;PG10062;69;the prisoners were crowded like cattle in the immense warehouse in squads of a hundred or more.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;69;the father's grief and the unhappy situation of his whilom enemy touched the lad, forgetting jack's and vincent's warning, dick said, impulsively,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;69;"an old college friend of jack's has been very kind to us."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;70;it was only when jack commended his astuteness, afterward, that dick realized the adroitness of his own diplomacy.

poppy;Papaver;organism;PG10062;70;a colored woman, with a flaming turban on her head, opened the door as she saw them coming up the trim walk lined with shells and gay with poppies, bergamot, asters, and heliotrope.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;70;the next day dick left his aunt at the cottage with kate, and warning them that he should be gone all day, and perhaps not see them until the next morning, he set off for rosedale, where he told jack kate's plight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;70;"jack, we must send for them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;70;it was the very thought on jack's mind, and straightway the carriage was made ready, with ample pillows and what not.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;70;dick set out in great state, filled with the importance of his mission and the glory of jack's cordial praises.

yellow flag;Iris pseudacorus;organism;PG10062;71;an order was issued that all houses where wounded or ailing men were lying should signalize the fact by a yellow flag or ribbon, attached to the front in a conspicuous place.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;71;thus directed, dick walked street after street, asking to see the wounded, and the fourth day, coming to a residence, rather handsomer than the others on the street, not two blocks from mrs. raines, jack's samaritan, he found a wasted figure, with bandaged head and unmeaning eyes, that he recognized as barney.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;71;that night he wrote to jack, asking instructions, and the next day received a note, written by olympia, advising that barney be left with his present hosts until he recovered consciousness, that by that time vincent would be able to come up to town and explain matters to the deluded family.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;71;wesley was still subject to dizziness if exposed to the sun, but jack and vincent were robust as lumbermen.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;71;in his drives and walks about the james and williamsburg, jack saw that the country was stripped of the white male population.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;71;jack looked forward to the event with the most dismal discontent.

drill;Mandrillus leucophaeus;organism;PG10062;71;to be tied up here, far from his companions, to seem to enjoy ease, when his regiment was indurating itself by drills, marches, and the rough life of the soldier for the great work it was to do, maddened him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;72;some hint of jack's discontent, or rather of his vague dream of flight, came into dick's busy head, and when one day they were tramping down by the james together, he said, owlishly,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;72;"i say, jack, when vincent goes, let us clear out!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;72;"oh, keep your powder dry, jack!

hornet;Vespa;organism;PG10062;72;"i'm not your master, you young hornet, i can't see what you're doing all the time.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;72;jack being unprovided with regimentals, vincent wore civilian garb, to spare the "prisoner",as jack jocosely called himself,mortification.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;72;obtainable in richmond, mrs. atterbury enjoying with gentle malice the rueful perplexities of her prisoner guests, jack, wesley, and richard, as they surrounded the board in this rebel attire.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;73;i manoeuvre for some time for the discarded color," jack said, one evening.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;73;jack looked up, startled, and glanced swiftly at dick.

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10062;73;how do you propose disposing of your tobacco and cotton this year?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;73;jack asked, gravely.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;73;jack cried, aghast.

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10062;73;i learn in letters from friends in the west that all the cotton crop has been contracted for by men either in the northern army or high in the confidence of the administration.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;73;you see, jack, we are not the arcadian simpletons you think us.

cotton;Gossypium;organism;PG10062;73;we've got cotton and tobacco, you must have both, you've got money, we must have that.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;73;all at the table had listened absorbedly to this strange revelation, and jack rose from the table shocked and discouraged.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;74;olympia seated herself at the piano, and, slipping out, as he supposed, unseen, jack strolled off into the fragrant alleys of oleander and laurel.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;74;"trying to get closer, i made a rustling of the bushes, and the young imps shot through them like weasles before i could lay hands on them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;74;jack challenged her to a jaunt.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;74;"do you remember the scene in shakespeare where bolingbroke and gaunt pluck the roses?"

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;75;she assented with an affirmative movement of the head, and they walked through the fragrant paths, plucking a rose now and then that seemed more tempting than its fellows.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;75;at the end of the field of roses a cherokee hedge grew so thick and high that it formed a screen and rampart between the house land and a dense grove of pines which was itself bordered by a stream that here and there spread out into tiny lakelets.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;75;jack qualifiedly replied.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;75;"ah, yes, because the tree of our life, the volume of our knowledge, or, in plain prose, our hearts, are not here, and scenic beauty is a poor substitute for that.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;75;he pulled the rude shallop to her feet and they got in and went on, jack not heeding her gibe.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;75;jack made a poor fist with this, but there was no need of rowing.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;75;kate, catching a projecting limb from the thick bushes on the margin, sent the little, wabbling craft onward in noisless, spasmodic plunges.

columbine;Aquilegia;organism;PG10062;75;deep fringes of wild columbine fell in fluffy sprays from the higher banks as the boat drifted along the other side.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;75;the thickets were musical with the chattering cat-birds and whip-poor-wills, mingled with a score of woodland melodists that jack's limited woodcraft did not enable him to recognize.

florida;Roystonea regia;organism;PG10062;75;we are as isolated here from all vestiges of civilization as we should be in a florida everglade," kate said, as the little craft swam along in an eddy.

larch;Larix;organism;PG10062;75;the place might be called primeval,look at those gnarled roots, like prodigious serpents, see the shining bark of the larch--i think it is larch--i should call it 'slippery' elm if it were at acredale, but see the fantastic effects of the little lances of sunlight breaking through!

bird;Aves;organism;PG10062;75;kate glanced into the weird deeps of foliage, where a bird, fluttering on the wing, aroused strange echoes.

snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10062;76;"i don't know the habits of southern snakes, but if they are as well-bred as ours, they retire from the ken of wicked men at sundown, so we needn't fear them, as the sun is too far down for the snake of tradition to see or molest us."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;78;jack darted through the screen of branches, but he could not distinguish the figures, for it was growing every instant dimmer twilight.

cut-throat;Amadina fasciata;organism;PG10062;78;"there is some 'caper' going on to give these cut-throats a chance to get booty or something of the sort."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;78;they were in the boat now, and jack was sending it forward by lusty lunges against every protruding object he could get a stroke at, when these failed he managed to scull after a fashion.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;78;they found the household in consternation when they got back, but jack gave a picturesque narrative of their escapade, omitting the encounter with the negroes which he had charged kate to say nothing about, as it would only alarm mrs. atterbury.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;78;the feast was of the lightest sort,sherbet or tea for those who liked it, fruit and crackers, honey or marmalade--a triumph in the cultivation of dyspepsia, jack said when he first began the eating.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;78;he was just in the ardent period when boys love to make mysteries of very ordinary things, and jack's sotto voce command was like the hero's voice in the play, "meet me by the ruined well when midnight strikes."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;78;he followed jack up the wide staircase and into his own room, for greater security, as no one would think of looking for them there.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;78;"now, tell me all you have found out," jack commanded as he shut the door.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;78;"well, you keep an eye on wesley," and then jack narrated the strange scene in the swamp, the mysterious calls, and the conversation.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;79;everybody was there, vincent had just come, and the first words jack and dick heard glued them to their places.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10062;79;"captain cram, who is in camp just below in the oak clearing, is ordered to scour the river-bank to the enemy's lines near hampton, so we need have no fear of these enterprising apostles of freedom interfering with our niggers."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;79;"i'm glad to hear your mother express such confidence, vint," jack said as they walked out on the veranda to take a good-night smoke, "but just let me give you a maxim of my own, the lock's not sure unless the key is in your pocket."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;80;"i am heartily relieved to hear it," jack cried, giving something too much fervor to his relief, for vincent turned and looked at him in surprise, but it was too dark in the shadow of the clematis to see his face, and after a silence vincent said,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;80;"i will strive to bear my honors with humility," jack said.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;80;but jack could not comprehend this, and quite innocently did and said things to arouse the young girl's dreams.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;80;i think i have said that jack was a very comely fellow?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;80;rosa was not long in discovering vincent's happy tumult in olympia's presence, and she secretly misunderstood jack the more that he was so lavish and open in his adulations.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;80;if he rode, he exhausted eulogy in describing her pose, her daring, her skill, if they danced, as they did nearly every night until poor merry's fingers ached from drumming the unholy strains of faust, strauss, and what not, in the old-fashioned waltzes--he pantingly declared that she made the music seem a celestial choir by her lightness, in long walks in the rose-fields he exhausted a not very laborious store of botanical conceits, to make her cheeks resemble the roses.

fern;Polypodiopsida;organism;PG10062;80;the morning after the coming of the cavalry-troop, wesley was discussing the never-ending theme of how he was going to get home--with kate busy arranging the ferns she had brought from the swamp.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;80;you're worse than jack sprague.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;81;but he remarked with ungovernable wrath that, whenever jack or wesley came about, the heartless young jilt, made as if she didn't know him, quite ignored him, and cared no more for his simple adoration than she did for the frisky gambols of pizarro, the mastiff.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;81;when he had stalked along through the currant bushes, he half turned his face, she was walking demurely behind him, and he made a pretext of picking a currant to give her a chance to come abreast.

crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10062;82;"there is a crab thorn an inch long in my foot, it's gone through shoe and all.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10062;82;do you suppose i would sit here like a goose on a gridiron and let you hold my foot if it didn't hurt?

sole;Paraplagusia;organism;PG10062;82;he affected to examine the sole of the thin leather of the upper still more minutely.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;82;"well, now we'll test these propositions, as jack does, by syllogisms.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;83;"nonsense, rosa, it is perfectly proper, everybody makes love to you, jack makes love to you, and he is as good as engaged--" but here it suddenly flashed in dick's mad head that he was meddling, and he stopped short.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;83;"you cost me enough to be dear and you are lovely enough to be 'rosa' in latin, rose in english, and sweetheart in any tongue."

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;84;"but the red rose is my favorite."

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;84;it is a promise, when this white rose is red you will love me?"

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;84;are you two grafting roses?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;84;vincent had represented to jack the inconvenience it would be, the peril, rather, for him to assume the guardianship of so many enemies of the confederacy.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;85;then, with funds supplied by jack, he gained admittance to a modest house far out on main street, where the city merges into the country.

willow;Salix;organism;PG10062;87;suffice it, therefore, to say that in the dim morning mist, as arranged, a shadowy host emerged on the river-bottom, now dry and footable, that each man, as he crawled from the pit, was directed into the thick willows bordering the banks, that when six score or more had clambered out they obeyed a whispered command, for which veronica had prepared them, and noiselessly, in shadowy single file, they followed the bed of the stream, even where the water flowed deep and dangerous, until they came to the gentle slopes of church hill.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;87;the rebels might spy them, might surround them, but they need not starve--the buds were food, the bushes refreshment, the pellucid pools drink and life.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;88;presently the melancholy bird-notes that had puzzled jack in the same vicinity days before broke out just in front of barney, who was clambering along, the third man from the head of the little column.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;89;both drew back in shadow, waiting with heart-beats that sounded in their ears like tramping horses on thick sward.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;90;when vincent visited the stables on the morning of that eagerly-looked-for thursday, he found three of the horses clammy with perspiration and giving every sign of having been ridden!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;90;he cried, as jack looked inquiringly, "i'm to set out to-night and report for duty with general johnston to-morrow at manassas.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;90;no more loitering in my lady's bower, jack, my boy, the carpet will be clear for your knightly pranks after to-night."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;90;"the sun of the south is not the sun of york to us, you know, all the clouds that lower on our house are doubly darkened by this southern sun, even the warmth of rosedale hearts can not make up for our eclipsed northern star," jack said, sadly, with a wistful look at the rival warrior reading with sparkling eyes the instructions accompanying the order to march.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;90;"until jack is exchanged, you've certainly no duty in the north so important as watching over this headstrong fellow.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;90;vincent looked at jack solemnly, but made no answer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;91;jack must have his family on the ground, to watch over his interests.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;91;i am sure there is some underhand work responsible for this long delay in his case, for i saw by the whig , last week, that exchanges of prisoners had been made, i think that--" but, suddenly remembering the presence of kate and wesley, she did not finish the thought, which implied a belief in the intervention of the elder boone--to jack's detriment.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;91;atterbury that there was danger to jack in a longer stay of his family in the confederate lines.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;91;such a charge, as things stood, would be fatal to jack, and the mother's duty was plain.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;91;she had a long talk with jack on the subject.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;92;of late--jack's state being secure--she had revived much of the old vivacity, and deepened the thrall that held him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;92;perhaps jack's death?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;92;kate, jack, and dick were pressed into the service of decorating the apartments.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10062;92;olympia will like to see that--the haunt of her favorite bird", and the busy little maid laughed cheerily, like a disordered goddess, intoxicated by the exhaling odors of the floral chaos.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;92;roumelia was the name jack had given the rose-lands near the stream, in fanciful allusion to the turkish province of flowers.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;93;"oh, that is a large question, involving too much mental strain in a garden of roses, where the senses sleep and one is content with mere breath and the faintest motion."

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;93;"there are enough roses, now we will go for the wild smilax and honeysuckle, perhaps the cool air of the pools will restore your mental activities."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;95;jack was secretly very much delighted with the review.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;95;"you must remember, jack, our army is made up of gentlemen's sons, the gentry of the south are all in arms, and we can't at once reduce them to the mere machines a more heterogeneous soldiery can be made.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;97;davis was placed at mrs. atterbury's right, mrs. sprague at her left, general lee sat at vincent's right, vis-a-vis to jack, who was lost in prodigious admiration of the socratic-like chieftain--lee was as yet unknown to all but a discriminating few in the confederacy.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;97;"mr. president, give me an exchange north, and i will ascertain the facts in the million-dollar offer and write you faithfully how to set about getting the money," jack said, very soberly, from his end of the table.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;97;rosa blushed, jack felt foolish, and everybody laughed except dick, who looked unutterable things at his adored, and boldly entered the lists against the great personage by asking, in a quivering treble,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;98;olympia and jack stood at the great gate in mournful silence.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;98;no, it was better to suffer this slight inconvenience to have vincent's protecting presence all the way to the union lines, and jack, acknowledging this, didn't say a word to dissuade her.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;98;vincent's last act was to call jack to his room.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;98;"i wanted to tell you, jack, what a great joy it has been to me--it has been to all of us--to have you in our home at this trying time.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;98;jack cried, taking the weapons out.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;98;there were sad, sobbing farewells spoken--the kindly night covering the tears, and the loud neighing of the horses drowning the sobs.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;98;the horizon to the zenith was full of shimmering star-points, olympia, with jack, turned slowly toward the house, silent and not wholly sad.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;99;he knew that in the daily attrition and conventional intimacies of the table, the drawing-room, or the promenade, the cloak covering his resentful antipathy, his moral perversities, his thinly veiled impatience, was worn to such thin shreds that eyes keen as jack's must see and know him as he was.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;99;wesley was no coward, and he ached to meet jack face to face, arm to arm, and settle with that thoughtless insubordinate a rankling list of griefs heaped up in moments of over-vivacious frankness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;99;he would make jack smart for his arrogance, his insolence, his cursed condescension so soon as they were back among the caribees.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;99;jack was a hobbledehoy son of the house, almost as much as vincent.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;99;jack's fondness for kate had not escaped the observant eyes of dick, who had confided the secret to rosa, who had likewise unraveled it to mamma, and, as she kept nothing from vincent, the atterburys had that sort of interest in kate that intimate spectators always show in love affairs, where there are no clashing interests involved.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;99;atterbury declared that jack was not in love with miss boone.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;100;he seems to recite a good deal to the mistress, and occupies the dunce's block quite regularly," vincent retorted, with a provoking significance that set mamma in a brown study and suspended the comments on kate's and jack's probable sentiments.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;100;mrs. sprague and wesley were the only people in the house who had no suspicion of a deeper feeling than mere passing goodfellowship between jack and kate.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;102;are jack and he going to sit and smoke, as they often do?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;102;perhaps to jack's room?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;102;in a moment wesley is back in his room, marking, with surprise, that there is no sound from jack's or dick's room.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;102;he sat glowing in dreams of such delicious, roseate delight, that he took no heed of time, and was startled when he heard dick and jack bidding each other good-night.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;104;rosa broke from the thick cloud of smoke as a fifth report rang out, and a scream of death went up between the bed and the door where jack stood.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;104;at the instant dick spoke, jack, in the doorway, heard an exclamation at his side.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;104;the man at jack's back now cried,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;jack and barney were hurrying toward the chamber as the latter talked, jack filled with an awful fear.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;now, the timely--or untimely--appearance of jack and dick in the crisis of the plot came about in this way,dick, on returning from jack's room, had remarked, with quickening suspicion, a gleam of light under wesley's door.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;besides, jack had warned him not to interfere, with a mere escape on wesley's part, unless it seemed to involve depredations upon the atterburys.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;should he slip over and warn jack?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;now he must go and warn jack, but he must note first whither the assassins were directing their attack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;perhaps, with the aid of jack's pistols, they could be frightened away by a few shots from the windows.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;he ran noiselessly to jack's room, to his bed, and whispered in his sleeping ear,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;"jack, make no noise, dress yourself and come.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;jack was awake and in his clothes in a few seconds.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;105;jack leaned far out to discover what this diversion meant.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;105;the shrill whinny of horses broke on the air.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;106;the invaders were thus screened from jack and dick when they had turned the corner, and the latter were forced to move with painful caution to get the advantage of surprise to offset superior numbers.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;106;"we will wait until the new-comer or new-comers are abreast," jack breathes in dick's ear, "and then fire a volley into them point blank."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;106;dick is over the intervening steps in two mighty bounds, jack at his heels and the foe in the rear following.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;106;jack, in the dim light, sees the dark figure dashing at him with the gleam of steel in his hand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;106;jack turned to confront them.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10062;106;yes, the dog, the dog has come upon the scene.

dog;Canidae;organism;PG10062;106;yes, the dog, the dog has come upon the scene.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;106;there is sound of low, fierce, growling, flying footsteps on the floor, and jack, assuring himself by a quick glance that there were no more marauders in the room, hurried to see that the front door was closed before re-enforcements could come to the invaders.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;106;jack halted, transfixed, horror-stricken, in the doorway.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;107;jack moved to the piteous group, and, dropping on his knees, felt the lifeless pulse, and sank back, pale and shrinking, with the feeling that he was a murderer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;107;jack found tongue now.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10062;107;"the white rose is red now, rosa."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;107;she took the painful duty of order upon herself, sent jack to summon the servants, called barney to her aid in removing dick to his room, and, when the terrified housemaids came, distributed the rest to the nearest apartments.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;107;morning had dawned when the work was done, and then jack set out to investigate the condition of the quarters.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;107;it was easy to trace them to the swamp, but jack made no attempt to organize a pursuit.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;107;she begged him to take horse to williamsburg, bring the surgeon, and deliver a note to the commanding officer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;mrs. atterbury announced to jack and olympia that so soon as dick could bear removal the house would be closed and the family return to richmond.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;to jack it was a reminder of his misfortune, and to every one of the group it was associated with crime, treason, and blood.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;the hardest part of poor jack's burden was the seizure of barney, who was marched off by the cavalry commander.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;vincent gone, jack had no one to reach the ear of authority, and he shrank from asking the intervention of the mistress whose home had been invaded by the guiltless culprit.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;the case was stated with all the eloquence jack was master of to the captain in command.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;jack saw the futility of further pleading.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;olympia accompanied her in the carriage, jack riding with the escort.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;kate refused every suggestion to see jack, refused his own prayerful message, and sternly, solemnly with her dead passed from the scene of her sorrows.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10062;108;youth and something else stronger than medicine, more tenacious than any other motive that keeps the life-current brisk and vigorous, made dick's recovery swift and sure.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;olympia was the confidante of both the lovers, listened with her usual good-humor to the boy's raptures and the girl's panegyrics, and soon came to share jack's high place in the happy lovers' devotion.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;jack meanwhile sank into incurable gloom.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;108;atterbury saw it, and the first week in november rosedale was turned over to the military and the household re-established in the stately house in the official quarter of richmond, where the bustle and movement of new conditions gave jack's mind another direction, or, rather, took it from the bitter brooding that threatened madness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;109;it was by mingling--at first perfunctorily--in the gayety of the confederate capital that jack lost the melancholy in which the tragedy at rosedale had clothed his spirits.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;109;to resist its seductions would have tasked the self-denial of a more constant anchorite than our dashing jack ever aspired to be, in the lowest stage of his martial vicissitudes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;109;jack was amazed and disheartened at what he saw and heard.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;110;though it was the first week of november when the atterburys found home affairs going on smoothly in the town-house, summer still disputed with winter the short lovely days of fall, as jack described the lingering may-day mildness of this seductive southern autumn.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;110;at least jack took this philosophical view of it, and soon gave himself up to the merry social life of his surroundings with an animation that led his hosts to hope that he might be won over to the confederate cause.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;110;very young men do not sorrow long or deeply, and jack was young.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;110;as a matter of fact, however, jack was not insensible to the awkward complication of his predicament.

roundhead;Plesiopidae;organism;PG10062;110;his interest in the strange scenes that the war brought to pass, his association with people--intimate in a sense with the leading forces of rebellion, the airs of incipient grandeur, these raw instruments of government gave themselves--all these things engrossed the observant faculties of the young man, who looked out upon the serio-comic harlequinade playing about him as a hostage of the roundheads might have taken part in the showy festivities of the cavaliers, in the years when the chances of battle had not gone over wholly to the puritans.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;110;jack, writing and talking of his few months' experience, dwelt with wonder upon the curious ignorance of the two peoples respecting each other.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;110;the people--jack sagaciously remarked, in discussing the topic with olympia--seemed made for such a climate, rather than made by it.

courser;Cursorius;organism;PG10062;110;they would have been out of place in the bleak autumn blasts, and wan, colorless seasons of acredale, where the sun, bleary and dim, furtively skirted the low horizon from november until april, as if ashamed to be identified with the glorious courser that rode the radiant summer sky.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;111;"no wonder," jack said to his sister, watching this daily spectacle--"no wonder these people are warm, impulsive, and even energetic, here is an italian climate without the enervating languor of that sensuous sunshine."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;111;never had her "teas," her musicales , her receptions, and fetes been merrier or more convivial than during this memorable autumn that jack and olympia passed as prisoners of war.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;111;it was at a reception given to the cabinet by mrs. atterbury that the rumor of this accredited function came to jack's ears.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;111;for some reason this potential personage let olympia and jack see that she was deeply interested in them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;111;"no one would be apt to associate you with such a thing," jack said, vaguely.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;112;"and i have no doubt you have shaken his obstinacy, if there be any left," mrs. rodney murmured, studying jack attentively.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;112;"i take that as rather an admission of weakness on your president's part," jack said, as the lady glanced inquiringly at him, "since it is a poor cause that requires the strongest advocates."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;112;mrs. gannat arose to receive the great lady, and when she had exchanged salutations with the rest she presented jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;112;jack, not knowing the personages, simply listened.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;113;jack said, hastily presenting himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;113;jack led his petulant companion into the large drawing-room, where he instantly recognized the president with mrs. wendolph on his arm.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;113;the music began what jack thought at first was a funeral march, but with the first bars the tall, slender figure of the president bent almost double, while the lady seemed fairly seated on the floor, she bent down and back so far.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;114;in the melee of separation, jack felt a hand on his shoulder.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;114;jack had hardly turned as these words were whispered in his ear, and he gave the kind lady's hand a warm pressure, as she moved away unremarked in the throng.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;114;jack, confiding mrs. gannat's disclosures to olympia, was elated by his sister's enthusiasm, and was strengthened in his conviction that he was doing right by her approval.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;114;it won't do to rush into a trap, as you did at manassas, and, o jack, what is to become of dick?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;114;"yes, the impulsive little beggar, i believe he would," jack said, his eyes glistening.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;115;jack laughed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;115;when jack had cautiously laid the situation before his young patroclus, that precocious warrior at once justified the confidence reposed in him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;115;there was a piteous quaver in the treble voice, and, forgetting that he was no longer a school-boy, he brushed his eyes furtively with his coat-sleeve, as jack pretended preoccupation with his shoe-string.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;116;ah, rosa, i wish i were like jack!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;116;"i think jack's very nice, but i know somebody that's much nicer," rosa replied, busy with a rough material that was plainly intended for the southern warriors.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;116;but if you really knew all about jack, you wouldn't look at anybody else," dick cried, pensively, tangling his long legs in the young girl's work.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;116;it was in this sartorial industry that jack, coming in, presently discovered the pair.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;116;the recreation to which jack and dick were bidden was a visit to the melancholy shambles where the heterogeneous mass of unclassified prisoners were detained.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;116;it was an animated and curious group that made up jack's party.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;116;on the lower tier he pointed out the cells of the rosedale prisoners, where, as you may imagine, jack and dick, without giving a sign, kept their wits alert.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;he was no longer the bearded desperado jack had seen in the melee at rosedale--there was a certain distinction in the poise of the head, an inborn gentility in the impassive contemplation with which he met the furtive scrutiny of the curious visitors.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;jack he eyed with something of surprise, but when dick pushed suddenly in front of the timorous group of young women, he started, changed color, and averted his face, then, as if suddenly recalling himself, turned and devoured the lad with a strange, yearning tenderness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;dick met the gaze with his habitual easy gayety, and, turning to jack, said, impulsively,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;dick murmured the last words so low that the group of visitors did not catch them, and, adding to them an emphasis of the eye that the prisoner seemed too agitated to notice, he continued, as jack pushed nearer, "this is certainly not the man we saw at rosedale.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;jack cried.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;the aide had gallantly gone forward in the passage to reassure the ladies, and jack, seizing the chance, for which the prisoner seemed to be prepared, whispered,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;he remained limp and stolid in the supporting arms of jack, while dick, hovering in the doorway, kept the prying remnant of the visitors, eager to witness the scene, at a safe distance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;when the water came jack yielded his place to the guard and the party moved on.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;117;"but, mr. jack, if you should talk to him, show him the wickedness of conspiring against a peaceful family, inciting a servile race to murder, i'm sure you could move him, and it would be such a comfort to have the criminals themselves expose the atrocious plot."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;118;jack caught her eye as she spoke, and instantly realized the covert meaning.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;118;but at this interesting point of the combat jack returned, and, pushing-to the door, cried, as if in surprise, "hello, barney, boy, what are you doing here?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;118;"diverting the ladies, jack, dear, and giving the captain a chance to practice command, for fear he'll not get a show in battle."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;118;marc anthony gave up the world for a kiss, you'd capitulate a kingdom for a joke," jack said, striving to catch barney's eye and warn him to be prudent.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;118;"well, jack, dear, between the joke and the kiss, i think i'd go out of the world better satisfied with the kiss, at all events, it wouldn't be dacent to say less with so many red lips forninst me," and barney winked untold admiration at the laughing group before him, all plainly delighted with his conquest of the captain.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;118;he thinks that perhaps i can convince you of the wiser course to follow," jack said, with a meaning light in his eye.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;119;"i knew you would," jack said, approvingly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;119;barney whispered, eying jack curiously.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;119;this was said for the benefit of the guard, who had approached as jack arose to take his leave.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;119;helpless and hopeless as jack's situation seemed, the very poverty of his resources, helped the daring scheme of escape that filled his mind night and day during these apparently indolent weeks of pleasuring in the ranks of his enemies.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10062;120;before richmond became a mart in the modern sense, the gannat mansion, set far back among the trees of a noble grove, was a shrine to the tradition loving citizens, for, beyond any southern city, save perhaps new orleans, richmond folk cherished the memory of aristocratic and semi-regal ancestors.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;120;jack remembered vaguely the gossip of an engagement between his father and a famous southern beauty, and when the lady in the course of the conspiring said, as they talked, "my son, i might have been your mother," he knew that this gentle-voiced, kindly-eyed matron was the woman his father had loved and lost.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;120;jack's unique position, and dick's attitude of the half-acknowledged fiance of an atterbury, broke down bars that even mrs. gannat's far-reaching sagacity might not have been able to cope with in certainty.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;120;jack, however, was tortured by a doubt of dick's constancy when it came to an abrupt quitting of his sweetheart.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;120;jack, luckily, was sitting beside him, and brought his heel down on the lad's toes with such emphasis that he uttered a cry of pain.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;120;he shall be a yankee, he shall make nutmegs, he shall abuse the chivalrous south, he shall be what he likes, he sha'n't be teased--" and she wound her bare arms about his neck, quite indifferent to the reproving nudges of mamma and the sad mirthfulness of jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;121;you can stay if you choose," jack said, as they entered the dressing-room.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;121;"dick," jack whispered, "it's an omen.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;121;jack's heart went out to the lad, and he thought the chances about even that when the moment of trial came the boy's resolution would give way.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;121;as soon as this formality was ended, rosa whisked dick in one direction while mrs. atterbury asked jack to take her to the library.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;121;jack bowed low as he relinquished the good lady's arm, feeling as if he were embarking on some odious treason, in view of her persistent and generous treatment of him and his.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;121;"oh, you needn't think that you can take conge for good, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;121;"you will always know where to find me, but i am not so sure that i shall be as able, as i am willing, to come to you," jack said, trembling at the double meaning of his words.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;121;she had turned from the throng of ladies, who were discussing a political secret, and her eyes melted tenderly as vincent's name passed jack's lips.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;122;dick, meanwhile, not so dexterous in expedients or ready in speech as his mentor, became wedged in an eddy, just outside the main stream, pouring drawing-room ward, so that, returning to the spot where they had separated, jack did not, for the moment, discover him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;122;jack and i are going to walk a little while, and then we--we shall be more ourselves."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;123;"mr. jack!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;123;for the voice was jack's--"dick is very ill, and he must go home at once.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;123;"yes, rosa, jack is right.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;123;kiss me as if i were going to the field," dick whispered as jack's back was turned.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;123;"i can't do it, jack," dick suddenly broke out, as they hurried through the dark street.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;123;jack ejaculated as dick, taking advantage of a cross-street, shot off into the darkness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;123;jack halted.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;123;he would come back--jack tried to make himself believe that he could depend on that.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;123;perhaps, in view of the chance, it would be better to anticipate the hour of flight, as, unfortunately, the horses that had been got together for the fugitives were in use for the davis guests, and on such short notice others could not be provided without exciting suspicion or pointing to the agency by which the liberation had been brought about.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;123;"ah, if dick were only here," jack groaned, "we could go to the square and lead away enough staff or orderly horses to serve the purpose.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;124;the sentinel on the high level to the rear could not see the ground along the wall, and it was this fact which jack calculated upon to enable him to help the prisoners to remove the debris of the wall through which they were to presently emerge.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;124;jack gave them final orders.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;124;jack was to guard jones's exit and dick barney's, but now all the work would devolve upon him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;124;jack lay quite still and raised his eyes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;124;figure to yourself any predicament in life in which vital stakes hang on the issue, figure to yourself the shipwrecked seizing ice where he had hoped for timber, the condemned criminal walking into the jailer's toils where he had laboriously dug through solid walls, the captain of an army leaving the field victor, to find his legions rushing upon him in rout, figure any monstrous overturn in well-laid schemes, and you have but a faint reflex of poor jack's heart-breaking anguish when this jocular fate stood above him, with the five gaping barrels pointed at his miserable head.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;125;on quitting jack, dick had but one thought in mind--to make his departure less abrupt for rosa.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;125;then, with an officer's uniform, he could be of much more help to jack and the party than in the rough civilian homespun furnished at the cabin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;125;he had had his mind full for days of the most tender sentiments and prettily turned phrases, but the turmoil of the last hour, the vital value of every moment to jack's plans, left him no time to compose the poem he had meditated so long.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;125;he easily finds a place to tie the horse, and, familiar with every inch of the outlying ground about the prison, crawls close to the wall, listening intently.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;125;where can jack be?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;125;perhaps jack has been caught reconnoitring?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;125;no, that was not like jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;125;this was his special part in the plan--if it were not done, jack was still about.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;125;he steals back over the low hillock, mounts the horse, and by a detour reaches the sentry guarding the river front of the prison.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;126;"hist, jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;126;jack pretended to be sound asleep when the soldier and dick entered.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;126;the sergeant, having read this, made no objection to releasing the alleged deserter, since there had been no orders concerning him, and, without more ado, jack walked away with his captain, the picture of abashed valor and repentant tipsiness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;127;when within a few feet, jack gave a sudden whack on the board and cried, sternly,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;127;dismount and come forward one man at a time," jack answered, briefly.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;127;as he came up, dick took the precaution of getting between him and his three companions, and then jack said,"i suppose you are all right, but my orders are to arrest all mounted men, detain their horses here in these, the provost stables," and jack pointed to dick's horse dimly outlined against the sky.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;127;in response to their light taps, a square of brick-work large enough to leave a space for a man to crawl through crumbled upon jack and dick, who held their bodies closely pressed against the debris to prevent too loud a noise.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;140;jack let enough time pass to give this ally full play in disabling the troopers, then taking barney to the rear of the cabin, whispered,

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;140;the boys will make a loud clatter with the horses, and we shall bag the game without a blow.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;inside the men were laughing uproariously, mingling accounts of love and war in a confused medley--how a sweetheart in petersburg was only waiting for the stars on her lover's collar to make him happy, how the yankees would be wiped out of the peninsula as soon as jack magruder got his nails pared for fight, how three yankees had been gobbled that day, and how others were in the net to be taken in the morning.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;the bacchanal was at its highest when jack, dashing into the open doorway, placed himself between the drinkers and their arms, and cried, sternly, as he pointed his pistol at the group,

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;141;gabe and his brother added to the effect of numbers by clattering the stirrups of the horses, so that the clearing seemed alive with armed men.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;the troopers, sobered and astonished, half rose, and then as these sounds of superior force emphasized the menace of jack's pistol in front and barney's in the rear, they sank back in their seats, the spokesman saying, tipsily,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;sergeant, bring in the cords," jack ordered.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;barney at this came in with a clothes-line jack had prepared from the negroes' posts.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;the arms of the three men were bound behind them, and then jack retired with his aide to hold a council of war.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;141;it was then agreed that barney should take the prisoners, the horses, and the old man, with the younger boys, and make for the union lines, not a mile distant.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;jack, meanwhile, with little gabe, would go to the rescue of dick.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;he was reminded of no joke by the present dilemma, and remained very solemn, as jack enlarged on the glories of the proposed campaign.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;141;jack and barney were forced to laugh at the big-eyed wonder in old rafe's eyes when he was informed of the imposing part he was to play in the warlike comedy.

cat;Felis;organism;PG10062;144;"sing out again, my friend, i haven't got cat's eyes."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;144;jack's grasp was on his throat and jack's mouth was at his ear.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10062;144;four men, undisturbed by this swift and noiseless coup, were stretched on the board floor, breathing the heavy, deep sleep of exhaustion.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;144;jack aroused them with the greatest difficulty, and found it still harder to make them understand that, with courage and resolution, they would be back in their own lines by daylight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;144;the men were to remain near the blockhouse, but not in it, until jack returned for the negro, and then under the lad's guidance they could find their way to the union outposts.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;144;they had skurried along half-way back toward the bluff, listening for a sound on the water and peering into the black surface, when denby suddenly touched jack's arm.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;148;then turning back, he strode the length of the long baize-covered table, sometimes absently picking up a document, until, facing her again as she narrated the story of jack's misfortunes, he would fling it hastily on the scattered heaps and fix his mild eye upon her.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;148;"why, mr. president, jack hasn't an enemy in the world!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;149;if jack shot wesley, it was because he was in some sort of treacherous business.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;149;kate had seized a chair and drawn it before the two who sat on one of the long sofas that filled without adorning the vast hotel parlor, dim even at noonday in its semi-subterranean light.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;149;kate, struggling with her tears, told the story so far as she knew it, but of course she knew little beyond the mere fact that wesley had come to his death in mrs. atterbury's room, that jack stood over him with the smoking pistol, and owned that he had fired in the darkness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;149;she told the tale as gently as might be, her own heart secretly pleading for everything of extenuation that might lessen jack's guilt, but she had insensibly taken the darker view her father had instantly adopted, that jack's enmity had led him to seize the chance to rid himself of a rival and enemy under cover of defending the atterburys.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;149;boone had charged jack with deliberate murder.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;150;she is near jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;150;much as i love jack, i would rather see him in his grave with the union flag over him than in the rebel lines, a soldier of that bad cause.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;150;the affair was no easy matter to trace, but, after inconceivable delays and persistent misleading, he found that jack was in the military archives charged with desertion, murder, and treason,desertion in quitting his company and regiment without orders, treason in consorting with armed rebels, and murder in joining with the enemies of the country to take the life of his commanding officer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;150;meanwhile, mrs. sprague and merry had returned to acredale, and the lawyer sent letters to richmond setting forth the case to jack--letters which, by some mysterious jugglery, never reached their address, as we have seen.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;150;nothing could be done until jack was either exchanged or until his advocate had made out a documentary case that could be presented to the military authorities.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;150;as he surmised, every one in authority had been prejudiced against jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;150;one of senator sprague's old friends, still in the senate, advised brodie to let jack remain at richmond till the peace came, "for," said he, "no democrat nor any one identified with that party can hope for impartial justice here."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;151;he listened to the melancholy story of jack's compromising plight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;152;the feud between the adherents of the houses of sprague and boone had become acrimoniously embittered by the point of view from which each side saw the conduct of jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;152;it was true that the spragues had contributed many thousand dollars toward the equipment of the caribees, had endowed twenty beds in one of the city hospitals for the wounded--but this was when jack expected high command in the regiment.

copperhead;Agkistrodon contortrix;organism;PG10062;152;at a great "war meeting" in the town-hall, over which boone presided, one thrilling orator hinted that fire, if not the law, could "relieve a loyal community of the copperhead's nest!"

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10062;152;every rebel sympathizer driven from the north would strengthen the union cause, ashes and salt sowed on the ground their insolent homes had desecrated, would be a holy reminder to the loyal, a warning to the secret foes of the union."

copperhead;Agkistrodon contortrix;organism;PG10062;152;lawyer brodie, who was present, arose under a thunder of discordant notes--"copperhead!"

copperhead;Agkistrodon contortrix;organism;PG10062;153;is this a copperhead community?

copperhead;Agkistrodon contortrix;organism;PG10062;153;is it possible, then, that the copperheads are supplying the money to carry on the war?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;153;then he narrated rapidly, but tellingly, the substance of what has been already set down in this history--the facts taken from jack's letters and attested by the corroboration of barney, dick, and the company's officers.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;153;there was a visible revulsion in the larger part of the audience as the tale went on, and when the lawyer wound up with the story of mrs. sprague's baffled efforts in washington to have her boy brought north, there was an outburst of applause and a faint cheer from the younger men for "glorious old jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;153;there was no longer any talk of burning the sprague property, and opinion was about evenly divided as to jack's conduct.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;154;some of them must have seen jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;154;in richmond the escape had been announced, then the news that the party had been surrounded in the swamp, then day by day details of the taking of straggling negroes and one or two soldiers, but no name that even resembled jack's.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;154;the atterburys, after the first painful sensation, had given their approval of jack's going, and used all means in their power to get such facts as would comfort olympia.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;154;they assured her that jack had reached the union lines, and then she had set out northward, expecting to find him at home or in communication with his family.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;154;no word from jack?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;154;she had given jack no peace, had fired dick to the fatal enterprise.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;until her friends made her see how much effect it would have in clearing jack's reputation she shrank from the publicity, but with that end in view--jack's honor--she wrote, and wrote with strength and clearness, the moving incidents of her brother's capture, captivity, and escape--or his bold effort to escape.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;the still, small voice that makes itself a force in the heart, which the poets call our mentor and the moralists conscience, had been painfully garrulous in kate boone's breast since the angry parting with jack at rosedale.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;at first, in the wild grief of wesley's death, she had hugged hatred of jack to her heart as a sublime revenge for the murder.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;but with the hot partisanship allayed in the long weeks of reflection preceding the rumor of jack's own death, she began dimly to admit of palliation in her lover's fatal act.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;but when the image of jack came to her mind, as it did day and night, it was as the gay, frank, chivalrous hotspur, as unlike a murderer as golgotha to hesperides.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;she had often been startled by her father's far-seeing, malignantly planned vengeances, and, now that the rumor of jack's death began to settle into belief, she was appalled by a sudden sense of complicity in a murderous plot.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;not that she believed her father capable of murder or its procuration, but, knowing his potency with the authorities, she saw that there were many ways in which jack might be sacrificed in the natural course of military duties.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;she began dimly to see that, at worst, jack's act was not the calculated murder her father held it to be.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;that process, whenever she began to gather the shreds, had led her mind straight to the conviction that jack's shot had been premeditated, that the chance had been prearranged with the enemies of her brother.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;had it been in self-defense--even in the heat of uncontrollable anger--she could have found mitigation for jack, but there was neither the justification of self-defense nor the plausible pretext of anger.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;one word of warning, which jack could have spoken, would have saved wesley from the rash, the dastardly attempt upon the rosedale household.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;the plot, in all its details, must have been known to jack or dick, else how explain their presence in the chamber, armed and ready for the murder?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;155;boone himself believed that jack's ignoble ambition and envy had been the main motives in the murder.

snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10062;156;"he's as like his father as two snakes in a hole.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;jack's the same.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;"no, jack hasn't a particle of the feeling you ascribe to him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;they were totally unlike in nature, and i think that jack felt deeply that he had been wronged by wesley's appointment.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;i think i can see how jack was led into the part he played.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;then boone, in irritable impatience, reminded her of her own earlier utterances, how from his first coming wesley had been treated with studied distrust, how he had been denied the boyish intimacy that existed between jack and dick, how he was insensibly made to feel that he was in the house under a different cartel from that of jack and dick, that he was a prisoner on parole, and his word was doubted.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;could jack be the base schemer her father depicted him?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;if jack had been loyal to him, loyal to her, wesley would have been warned that eager eyes were upon him, ready wits reading his purposes, and revengeful hatred ready to slaughter him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;when the news came that jack had lost his life in the very enterprise wesley had contemplated, kate collapsed under the shock.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;she had borne up with something like composure when wesley's death came upon her, but now, tortured by a sense of responsibility in jack's fate, she gave way to the grief she had so long repressed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;she would proclaim publicly that her brother had rashly courted his own death, that jack had unknowingly shot him down, as many a man does, in battle, shoot his best friend.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;156;but was there any certainty that the report of jack's death was true?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;157;it was injustice that had displaced jack in the command of the company.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;157;it was one evening when he came in, apparently in better spirits than he had shown since wesley's death, that she told him what had been filling her mind since jack's death.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;157;then, in an almost imploring tone of reproach, she retraced the harsh episodes in the father's dealings with the perleys, with the community, and, finally, the quarrel with the spragues, involving in it the lives of wesley and jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;157;jack was a mere boy, richard is a boy.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;157;if you had not alienated the spragues and encouraged wesley in overbearing jack, my brother would be alive to-day.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;157;my sweetheart--yes, jack was dearer than all the world to me--he would not be dead to-day.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;158;had jack left papers incriminating him?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;158;mrs. sprague is preparing to go in search of the body, but olympia won't give in that jack is killed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;158;she says that if he had been she certainly would have known it in richmond, for there are couriers twice a day from the rebel outposts to the capital, that the atterburys had taken special measures to learn the fate of the escaped prisoners, that, besides this, several young men in richmond, who knew jack well, had been sent down the peninsula with the prisoners, to befriend him in case he were retaken."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;158;"and olympia believes that jack is alive?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;158;perhaps i can help them in the search for jack, and you know there is no time to lose.

parrot;Psittaciformes;organism;PG10062;158;she squeezed the astonished merry's hand, convulsively, and shot off, leaving the bewildered lady quite speechless, so speechless that, when she reached the stately presence of aunt pliny, she forgot the commissions she had been sent to execute, and was at once reviled by the parrot as "a no-account dawdler."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;"no, i shall not believe jack is dead until i see his body.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;i know jack so well.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;poor jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;"i knew it, i knew you would, do it, i told jack so in richmond, almost the last words i said before he set out on this miserable adventure.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;it was not jack's bullet that entered poor wesley's body.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;jack was at his right, at the side of the bed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;"i remember that, but jack's remorse put all thought of everything else out of my head.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;oh, if i could only get that word to jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;"it isn't your fault, dear, that you didn't know jack as we do," olympia said, tenderly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;dead, he was bent on jack's dishonor, living, he would never rest until jack's life was condemned.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;159;the plans were agreed upon at once and the two girls separated, knit together by the same bond in more senses than one, for, while olympia set out to rescue her brother, she secretly hoped that the search would bring her near some one else, and so, as soon as kate had gone, she sat down and wrote vincent of jack's disappearance, asking his aid in finding such traces as might be in the rebel lines.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;160;i believe jack is alive.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;160;i wish jack could have heard that speech, it would have put power in his arm, as poor barney used to say."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;160;was jack indeed dead, and was his good name the object of her father's hatred?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;160;if in the morning no telegram came from acredale, it would be proof that her father was bent, implacably in his purpose to undo jack, living or dead.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;160;then we must visit every hospital in and near washington to find out from actual sight of each man whether jack or dick, or any one we know, is in the city.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;160;here was olympia, unconscious of jack's real peril if living, the menace to his reputation if dead, planning as composedly as if it were an every-day thing to have a brother lost in the appalling mazes of war, and she had been weakly depending upon her father, jack's most persevering enemy!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;161;jack is her darling, remember.

pioneer;Belenois aurota;organism;PG10062;161;i fancy, if we were as much wrapped up in him as she is, we should make poor pioneers in the wilderness before us."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;161;"i know no one of that name," olympia said, "but perhaps he might know something of jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;162;whom had her father been taking from the hospital--jack?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;162;yes--jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;162;if it were not jack, what interest could her father have in his removal?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;163;this was about the time jack had reached the union lines.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;163;if jones were not jack himself, he must have been one of the group that escaped with jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;163;her father was abducting a witness who could divulge jack's whereabouts, or he was secreting jack until be could work him harm.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;163;all doubt of her father's sinister intervention in jack's disappearance now took the form of certainty in the girl's mind.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;163;but i can say this much, when you see me again you shall know whether jack is alive or dead."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;163;it ought to comfort you to know that whatever human thought, courage, love can do to recover jack, i shall do, just as you would in my place.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;164;the loving are the daring--you will find jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;164;if, as she fearfully surmised, her father were engaged in some cruel scheme to the hurt of jack, her best way with him would be perfect frankness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;164;had dick escaped with jack?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;164;subtly calculated to make her believe that he had dismissed all thought of jack and was immersed in his own affairs.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10062;166;the tow hair stood up in wild dismay, and the blue eyes were perfect saucepans, as kate gently forced the money into the big palm.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;167;jack, wan, emaciated, on the verge of the grave?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;167;it was not jack, as she had feared and hoped.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;167;but he must know something of jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;168;kate had accused jack of cold-blooded murder.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;168;olympia had trusted her, had indeed given over into her hands the active work of finding the strangely lost clew of jack's whereabouts.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;168;if she could be sure that he was ulteriorly shaping events against jack--was acquainted with his whereabouts--she would have known exactly what to do.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;169;but, pilloried in doubt, shackled by the dread of exposing him in some hateful malevolence which would forever disgrace him in the community, she hardly dared stir, though she felt that every hour's delay was a new peril to jack in some way.

peony;Paeonia;organism;PG10062;169;it was hardly written when elkins himself appeared, radiant with satisfaction and blushing like a peony under lamplight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;171;the man wrote as if he had no idea that jack was not easily traceable, yet all the spragues' money and influence had been spent in vain.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;171;"jack and young perley."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;171;jack and young perley got me out of the tobacco warehouse.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;171;i was last to cross the bridge, and as i plunged into the thick bushes a bullet struck me, i knew no more until i found myself here.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;173;the driver whipped up his horses, but there wasn't much speed in them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;173;jack was undergoing an ignominious trial for murder--for desertion!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;174;providence has put your plans in my hands at nearly every step, but i was so ignorant that, of myself, the information would have done but little service to poor jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;174;"yes, jack can prevent it!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;174;"jack will be found.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;175;jones has undertaken to find out what became of jack after his arrival at the union outposts."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;175;i was afraid you had some sinister purpose in secreting him as the only link between jack and his friends.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;175;it gave me new life to find that you had been so tender and thoughtful to jones, for, as the event proved, he no sooner learned that there were apprehensions as to jack's safety, than he set about his discovery."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10062;175;the result was, that vincent's squadron was handsomely entrapped, and in the savage contest that ensued the intrepid major was hustled from his horse with a dislocated shoulder and broken wrist.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;175;jack's influence, he counted, would soon relieve him from the hardships of confinement, and then he should see olympia--that, at least, was recompense for his misfortune.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;175;he caused a letter to be written to jack, addressing it to his regiment, in care of the war department, and waited patiently the response.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;176;he was the prisoner jack had spoken with in richmond the day the party visited the tobacco warehouse.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;176;there he had learned that jack and dick had been wounded, fatally the story went, in the final volley fired by the pursuers.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;176;now how trivial vincent's fever in comparison with this appalling disappearance of dick and jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;177;jack told you when he got my letter?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;177;jack has never been seen or heard from since he escaped from your troops near the warrick.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;177;have you made inquiry in the company on duty where jack and his companions got into your lines?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;177;"we had begun to think that jack had been recaptured, but surely, if he were, you would have known of it."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;177;i can not make myself believe that jack is dead, though mamma has nearly made up her mind to it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;177;the mysterious part of the affair is, that we can not find one of the men who escaped with jack, though it was announced in the papers weeks ago that a party of them had arrived at fort monroe."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;178;there were three thousand inmates of the improvised city, but no one resembling jack or dick could be found.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;179;yes, it was jack--or a piteous ghost of him.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10062;180;early in the afternoon they were carried on a stretcher to a clean, fresh tent on the sandy beach, where the laurel bushes almost ran into the water.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;180;letters had been dispatched to olympia in forming her that jack was found, and urging her to come on at once.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;180;kate had, through olympia's unobtrusive manoeuvring, been forced to bear the burden of jack's nursing, and, somehow, when that impatient warrior mingled amorous pleadings with his early consciousness, she forgot upon which side the burden of repentance and forgiving lay.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;180;just before leaving point lookout jack received a much-directed letter that gave signs of having been in every mail-bag in the army of the potomac.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;180;it was from barney moore, bristling with wonder and turgid with woful lamentation at jack's coldness in not writing him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;180;so soon as he was sufficiently recovered to write, jack reported by letter to the regiment.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;180;jack, vincent, dick, and the rest, were to join them so soon as the invalid had taken rest in washington.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;180;the guard indulged jack in a carriage to headquarters.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;jack asked, as the officer touched a bell.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;the soldier saluted and motioned jack to follow him, two other soldiers closing in behind him as he set out.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;at the end of a short hallway the sergeant stopped, took a key from a bunch at his belt, unlocked a heavily-barred door and motioned jack to enter.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;steps came toward jack's cell--stopped, the key grated in the lock, some one touched him on the shoulder.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;at this jack started, his eyes gleaming wildly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;"no, no, not exactly that, jack, but we shall show them the mistake, i make no doubt."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;jack cried, shivering under the revulsion from despair to hope, and from hope back to horror.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;it was partly dread that the knowledge of jack's restoration might bring on more active hostility, as well as a whimsical feminine caprice to spring the great event upon him when all danger was over.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;181;she watched dick and rosa in the seat near her, for they, too, were of the advance guard to acredale, where, when olympia had arranged the house, vincent and jack were to come for final restoration to health.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;182;as it concerns jack you ought to know it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;182;frightful news concerning jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;182;the court--the charges against jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;182;you have brought the court to disgrace jack--to make him appear a deserter.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;184;"o doctor, she has been nursing jack, who was for weeks in the small-pox ward at point lookout!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;185;meanwhile, acredale had read with amazement, first, of the finding of jack sprague among the rebels at point lookout, then, the extraordinary story of the court-martial and death-sentence.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;185;dick, too, had flown to his adored jack, and acredale, confounded by the swift alternations in the young soldier's fortunes, settled down to wait the outcome with a tender sorrow for the bright young life eclipsed in disgrace so awful, death so ignominious.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;185;we have seen a moral combat in the minds of most of the people who have had to do with our luckless jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;186;she knew, and the light in her eye shone brighter as he rode in the darkness over the bare fields and through the sleeping towns to the capital, where jack's fate was hanging in the balance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10062;186;with boone's influence to aid them, jack's friends found a surprising change in the demeanor of the officials, hitherto captious and indifferent.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;2;thereafter he went his way, very sad and thoughtful, and that night, lying upon his bed, he heard the voices of the trees sighing and murmuring one to another like souls that sorrowed for sin's sake, and broken dreams and ideals.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;6;said the stranger, and rising, took from behind a tree a long and heavy lance and thrust it into beltane's grip, then, drawing his sword, he set it upright in the sward, and upon the hilt he put his cap, saying,

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;6;so beltane, lighting down from the horse that reared and plunged no more, went and fetched the great sword, and when they had laid their jerkins by,for the sun was hot,they faced each other, foot to foot and eye to eye.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;8;as he paced along upon his richly caparisoned steed, pinching at his long, blue-shaven chin with supple fingers, his heavy brows drawn low, of a sudden his narrowed lids widened and his eyes gleamed bright and black as they beheld my beltane standing in the shade of the tree.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;9;so beltane laid by his staff, and tightening his girdle, faced the hairy gefroi, and there befell that, the which, though you shall find no mention of it in any chronicle, came much to be talked of thereafter, so that a ballade was writ of it the which beginneth thus,'beltane wrestled in the green with a mighty man, a goodlier bout was never seen since the world began,' while beltane was tightening his girdle, swift and sudden gefroi closed, pinning his arms in a cunning hold, and thrice he swung my beltane from his feet so that many clapped their hands the while the squires and men-at-arms shouted lustily.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10064;9;"sweet my lord, it liketh me beyond telling, thy roan is a peerless beast!"

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10064;10;"and is the roan stallion thine" frowned the duke, "and to none would i lose him with a fairer grace, for 'twas a good bout as i foretold,yet, by the head of st. martin!

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;10;so saying, my lord duke gave his horse the spur and, as he passed the prostrate form of gefroi, leaned him down and smote the wrestler thrice with the whip he held and so rode on, bidding his followers let him lie.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;10;so saying my beltane turned upon his heel and strode away, while gefroi stood staring wide-eyed long after beltane was vanished amid the trees.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;10;and presently as he stood, his broad back set to the bole of a tree, his blue eyes lifted heavenwards brimful of dreams, he brake forth into a song he had made, lying sleepless upon his bed to do it.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;11;tall and stately were the trees, towering aloft, nodding slumberously in the gentle wind, fair were the flowers lifting glad faces to their sun-father and filling the air with their languorous perfume, yet naught was there so comely to look upon as beltane the smith, standing bare-armed in his might, his golden hair crisp-curled and his lifted eyes a-dream.

willow;Salix;organism;PG10064;11;merrily the brook laughed and sang among the willows, leaping in rainbow-hues over its pebbly bed, sweet piped the birds in brake and thicket, yet of all their music none was there so good to hear as the rich tones of beltane the smith.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10064;11;merrily the brook laughed and sang among the willows, leaping in rainbow-hues over its pebbly bed, sweet piped the birds in brake and thicket, yet of all their music none was there so good to hear as the rich tones of beltane the smith.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10064;11;thus beltane the maker of verses, all ignorant that any heard save the birds in the brake, sang of the glories of the forest-lands.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;11;then, the song being ended, forth from her cover rode the lady of mortain, and coming close where beltane leaned him in the shade of the tree, paused of a sudden, and started as one that is surprised, and beltane turning, found her beside him, yet spake not nor moved.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;12;behold now, these sighing trees love their lord the sun, and, through the drear winter, wait his coming with wide-stretched, yearning arms, crying aloud to him in every shuddering blast the tale of their great longing.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;12;"nay," quoth he, "a man's heart may be set on other things, flowers may seem to him fairer than the fairest women, and the wind in trees sweeter to him than their voices."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;12;but the duchess laughed again, and thinking to escape him, smote her horse so that it started and reared, once it plunged, and twice, and so stood trembling with beltane's hand upon the bridle, wherefore a sudden anger came upon her, and, bending her black brows, she raised her jewelled riding-rod threateningly.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;13;so beltane loosed the bridle, and in that moment, she laughed for very triumph and was off, galloping 'neath the trees.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;13;chapter iv of the love and the grief of helen the proud long stood beltane where she had left him, the soft shadows of night deepening about him, dreaming ever of her beauty, of her wondrous hair, and of the little foot that had peeped forth at him 'neath her habit, and, full of these thoughts, for once he was deaf to the soft voices of the trees nor heard the merry chatter of the brook.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;13;days came and went, and labouring at the forge or lying out in the sunshine gazing wistfully beyond the swaying tree-tops, beltane would oft start and turn his head, fancying the rustle of her garments in his ears, or her voice calling to him from some flowery thicket, and the wind in the trees whispered "helen!"

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;13;hereupon her white brow would grow troubled and, turning from them all, she would gaze with deep, unfathomable eyes, away across the valley to where, amid the mystery of the trees, beltane had his lonely dwelling.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10064;13;"have ye no love but for birds and flowers?"

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;15;so spake he, and turning, strode away, looking not back to where she stood leaning one white hand against a tree.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;16;so, swift and light of foot, she sped by hidden ways until she came where old godric, her chief huntsman, busied himself trimming the shaft of a boar-spear, who, beholding his lady, rose up in amaze.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;16;come, my godric, arm you and saddle two horses--come!"

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;16;come--the horses!"

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;16;fast and faster she rode 'neath the pale moon, her eyes ever gazing towards the gloom of the forest, her heart throbbing quick as the hoof-beats of her horse.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;16;autumn was at hand, and here and there the fallen leaves rustled sadly under foot while the trees sighed and mourned together for that the flowers so soon must wither and die.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;16;then a great loneliness and desolation came upon her and, sinking down at the foot of that tree whereby he had been wont to lean so often, her yearning arms crept about its rugged hole and she lay there in the passion of her grief weeping long and bitterly.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;16;but the gentle trees ceased mourning over their own coming sorrow in wonder at the sight, and bending their heads together, seemed to whisper one to the other saying,

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;32;but as beltane went, pondering the jester's saying, the drowsy stillness was shivered by a sudden, loud cry, followed thereafter by a clamour of fierce shouting, therefore beltane paused and turning, beheld the jester himself who ran very fleetly, yet with three lusty fellows in close pursuit.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;32;"messire," panted the jester, wild of eye and with a trickle of blood upon his pallid face, "o sweet sir--let them not slay me!"

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;32;now while he spake, and being yet some way off, he tripped and fell, and, as he lay thus the foremost of his pursuers, a powerful, red-faced man, leapt towards him, whirling up his quarter-staff to smite, but, in that moment, beltane leapt also and took the blow upon his staff and swung it aloft, yet stayed the blow, and, bestriding the prostrate jester, spake soft and gentle, on this wise,

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;33;but these foresters were right lusty fellows and they, together, beset my beltane so furiously, right and left, that he perforce gave back 'neath their swift and grievous blows and, being overmatched, turned and betook him to his heels, whereat they, incontinent, pursued with loud gibes and fierce laughter.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;33;then beltane leaned him, panting, upon his staff, what time the fallen man got him unsteadily to his legs and limped after his comrade, as for the jester, he was gone long since, only black roger lay upon his face and groaned faintly, ever and anon.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;33;wherefore came beltane and stood above him as one in thought and, seeing him begin to stir, took from him his sword and coil of rope and loosing off his swordbelt, therewith bound his hands fast together and so, dragged him 'neath a tree that stood hard by.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;36;so, dazed and breathless, came beltane on stumbling feet and leaned him gasping in the shadow of a great tree whereby stood giles o' the bow with arrows planted upright in the sod before him, the which he snatched and loosed so fast 'twas a wonder to behold.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;36;but, as for beltane, he leaned a while against the tree as one who is very faint, yet soon, lifting heavy head, wondered at the hush of all things, and looking toward the clearing saw it empty and himself alone, therefore turned he thitherwards.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10064;36;then beltane let fall his reeking sword and staggering out into the light, saw his bright mail befouled with clotted blood, and of a sudden the world went black about him and he fell and lay with his face among the trampled grass.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10064;38;then friar martin reached out his hand and laid it upon walkyn's bowed head,and, though the hand was hard and toil-worn, the touch of it was ineffably gentle, and he spake with eyes upraised to heaven,

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;38;said the friar, "within this doleful duchy be tyrants a many, and ye are but four, meseemeth, yet if within your hearts be room for pity--follow me, and i will show you a sight, mayhap shall nerve you strong as giants.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;38;so beltane followed the white friar with the three upon his heels who wrangled now no more, and in a while the friar paused beside a new-digged grave.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;39;so saying, the friar with sudden hand laid bare the still and marble bosom, and, beholding the red horror wrought there by cruel steel, beltane rose up, and taking off his cloak, therewith reverently covered the pale, dead beauty of her, and so stood awhile with eyes close shut and spake, soft-voiced and slow, 'twixt pallid lips,

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;39;said he,and, in a while, as they listened, upon the stillness came a rustle of leaves and thereafter a creeping step drawing slowly nearer,then swift and soft-treading, walkyn stole out into the shadows.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;39;very soon he returned, leading a woman, pale and haggard, who clasped a babe within her threadbare cloak, her eyes were red and sore with much weeping and upon the threshold she paused as one in sudden fear, but espying the friar, she uttered a cry,

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10064;39;"o father martin--good father--pray, pray for the soul of him who is father to my child, but who at dawn must die with many others upon my lord duke's great gallows!"

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;39;cried the friar, wringing his hands, "what news is this?"

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;39;"o good friar," sobbed the woman, "my lord's hand hath been so heavy upon us of late--so heavy,and there came messengers from thrasfordham in bourne bidding us thither with fair promises,--and my father, being head of our village, hearkened to them and we made ready to cross into bourne.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;40;then did the three, being upon their knees, lay their hands upon the sword and swear the oath as beltane commanded, now came the white friar and stared upon the sword and beholding the motto graven in the steel, lifted up his hand to heaven and cried aloud,--

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;44;fast strode the friar, his white robe fluttering on before, through moonlight and shadow, until they reached a brook or freshet that ran bubbling betwixt flowery banks, beside this strode the tall friar, following its winding course, until before them, amid the shadow--yet darker than the shadow --loomed high an embattled flanking tower of the walls of belsaye town, but ever before them flitted the friar's white gown, on and on until the freshet became a slow-moving river, barring their advance--a broad river that whispered among the reeds on the one side and lapped against rugged wall on the other.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;44;here the friar stayed to glance from gloomy wall and turret to fast waning moon on their left, then, girding up his gown, he stepped down into the reeds, and a moment later they saw him--to their amaze-- fording the river that flowed scarce knee deep.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;44;thus, slowly and carefully, because of the flowing of the water, they came betimes to where the friar waited in the shadow of the massy wall, yet, even as they came near, the friar waved his arm, stooped--and was gone, whereon my beltane stared amazed and the three muttered uneasily behind him.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10064;44;yet presently he saw a gleam before him that broadened with each step, and, of a sudden, was out beneath the sky--a narrow strip wherein stars twinkled, and so beheld again friar martin's white frock flitting on, ghost-like, before.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;45;so, keeping ever in the shadow of the great square keep, they went on, soft-treading and alert of eye till, being come to the angle of the wall, the friar stayed of a sudden and raised a warning hand.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;45;then came beltane with walkyn close behind, and peering over the friar's broad shoulders, they beheld a sentinel who stood with his back to them, leaning on his spear, to watch the burning gallows, his chain-mail agleam and his head-piece glittering as he stirred lazily in time to the merry lilt he sang softly.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;45;so, following ever the friar's lead, they came to a narrow doorway that gave upon a small guard-room lighted by a smoking torch socketed to the wall.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;45;the place was empty, save for a medley of arms stacked in corners, wherefore, treading cautiously, the friar led them a-down a narrow passage and so to a second and larger chamber where burned a fire of logs.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10064;45;then friar martin took a torch that smoked near by, and, crossing to the hearth, reached down a massy key from the wall, and with this in his hand, came to a door half hidden in a corner, beyond which were steps that wound downwards into the dark, a darkness close and dank, and heavy with corruption.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;45;at length the friar stopped before a mighty door, thick-banded with iron bars and with massy bolts, and while beltane held the torch, he fitted key to lock and thereafter the great door swung on screaming hinge and showed a dungeon beyond--a place foul and noisome, where divers pale-faced wretches lay or crouched, blinking in the torch's glare.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;55;slowly, slowly the dagger was lifted for the stroke while sir pertolepe watched the glittering steel patient and unflinching, then, swift and sudden the dagger flashed and fell, and sir pertolepe staggered free, and so stood swaying.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;67;and leaning thus, beltane marked well where the sentinels lolled upon their pikes, or marched drowsily to and fro betwixt the watch-fires, and long he gazed where the horses were tethered, two swaying, trampling lines dim-seen amid the further shadows.

sleeper;Eleotridae;organism;PG10064;68;awhile stood beltane, viewing the sleepers 'neath frowning brows, then, sheathing his sword, he turned and reached out his arms to the nun in the darkness and, in the dark, she gave herself, warm and yielding, into his embrace, her arms clung soft about him, and he felt her breath upon his cheek, as clasping his left arm about her, he lifted her high against his breast.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;68;riding close, beltane saw the glint of mail, raised his sword for the blow, felt a shock--a searing smart, and knew himself wounded, but now she was at his stirrup, and stooping, he swung her up to the withers of his horse, and wheeling short about, spurred to a gallop, yet, as he rode, above the rush of wind and thud of hoofs, he heard a cry, hoarse and dolorous.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;81;quoth the jester, clapping beltane's pale and bloody cheek,

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;82;growled a voice, and the jester was seized in a hairy hand and shaken till his bells jingled, and now beltane beheld his captor, a dwarf-like, gnarled and crooked creature, yet huge of head and with the mighty arms and shoulders of a giant, a fierce, hairy monster, whose hideousness was set off by the richness of his vesture.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;82;so they led beltane away jangling in his fetters, across divers courtyards and up a narrow, winding stair and thrust him within a chamber where was a bed and above it a loop-hole that looked out across a stretch of rolling, wooded country.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10064;83;then beltane's clutching fingers relaxed and he raised his head, blinking in the rays of the lanthorn, and looking upon his rumpled hair, the gaoler stared and peered more close.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;83;now upon the seventh evening as he sat thus, came sir pertolepe according to his wont, but to-night he leaned upon the shoulder of beda the jester, whose motley flared 'gainst rugged wall and dingy flagstone and whose bells rang loud and merry by contrast with the gloom.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;83;sighed the jester, "death shall take him over soon, as thou dost say--and there's the pity on't!"

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;84;and now through the hole in the floor behold a hand bearing a lanthorn--an arm--a shoulder--a shrouded head, thus slowly a tall, cloaked figure rose up through the floor, and, setting down the lanthorn, leaned toward beltane, putting back the hood of his mantle, and beltane beheld beda the jester.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;85;so speaking, beda the jester cut asunder the chain that bound the fetters, and beltane arose and stretched himself and the manacles gleamed on each wide-sundered wrist.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;85;whereat the jester, sitting cross-legged upon the floor, looked up at him and spake on this wise,

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;thereafter, beltane followed the jester down a narrow stair built in the thickness of the wall, and along a passage that ended abruptly, nor could beltane see any sign of door in the solid masonry that barred their way.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;a coin rang upon the stone floor, rolled into a distant corner and came to rest, the jester gasped in the shadow of the curtains, and so came silence, broke only by the soft drip, drip of the spilled wine.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;whispered the jester hoarsely at last, "what need was there for this--they would have slept--"

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;silently the jester went on before, by narrow passage-ways that writhed and twisted in the thickness of the walls, up sudden flights of steps until at length they came out upon a parapet whose grim battlements scowled high in air.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;but as they hasted on, flitting soft-footed 'neath pallid moon, the jester of a sudden stopped, and turning, dragged beltane into the shadows, for upon the silence came the sound of mailed feet pacing near.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;now once again beltane brake from the jester's clutching fingers and striding forward, came face to face with one that bare a pike on mailed shoulder, and who, beholding beltane, halted to peer at him with head out-thrust, quoth he,

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;thereafter, above the soft rustle of the night-wind, a sound far below--a faint splash, and beda the jester, shivering in the soft-stirring night wind, shrank deeper into the gloom and made a swift motion as though, for all his folly, he had crossed himself.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;"lord," whispered the shivering jester, "methinks i smell the dawn-- come!"

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;on sped the jester, staying not to light the lanthorn, nor once touching, nor once turning with helping hand to guide beltane stumbling after in the dark.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;86;here the jester paused to fit key to lock, to strain and pant awhile ere bolts shrieked and turned, and the door yawned open.

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;87;but lo, even as the jester spake, beltane turned, and striding down the tunnel, was swallowed in the dark.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10064;87;chapter xxvii how beltane took to the wild-wood a faint glimmer growing ever brighter, a jagged patch of pale sky, a cleft in the rock o'er-grown with bush and creeping vines, this beltane saw ere he stepped out into the cool, sweet air of dawn.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;88;so saying, roger turned aside into the denser wood, bursting a way through a tangle of brush, plunging ever deeper into the wild until they came to a place where great rocks and boulders jutted up amid the green and the trees grew scant.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;88;but at the foot of this cliff grew a tree, gnarled and stunted, the which, as beltane watched, black roger began to climb, until, being some ten feet from the ground, he, reaching out and seizing a thick vine that grew upon the rock, stepped from the tree and vanished into the face of the cliff.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;125;now roger's blow had been full lusty and sir robert yet lay a-swoon, seeing which, divers of his company, casting down their arms, cried aloud for quarter, whereat the townsfolk shouted but the fiercer,"slay them!

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;125;hereupon there came to him the white friar, who, looking earnestly upon his mailed face, uttered a sudden glad cry and caught his hand and kissed it, then turned he to the surging concourse and spake loud and joyously,

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;128;now hereupon beltane knew sudden shame and swift remorse, and bowed his head also, and would have prayed--yet could not, wherefore his black mood deepened and his anger grew more bitter.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;128;of a sudden, from the gloom beside the way rose a woman's scream, and thereafter a great and fierce roar, and presently came walkyn with his torch and divers of his men, dragging a woman in their midst, and lo!

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;129;but here once again came a hoarse and angry roar with the sound of desperate struggling amid the leaves hard by, whence came jenkyn and orson with divers others, dragging a strange, hairy, dwarf-like creature, great and shaggy of head and with the arms and shoulders of a giant, smirched was he in blood from a great wound above the brow and his rich habit was mired and torn.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;129;now looking upon this monstrous creature that writhed and struggled mightily with his captors, groaning and roaring betimes, beltane felt his flesh a-creep with swift and pregnant memory, and straightway beset the witch with fierce question,

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;141;thereafter came he to the destrier mars and, having saddled and bridled him with the same swift stealth, set foot in stirrup and would have mounted, yet found this a painful matter by reason of his wound, thus it befell, that, ere he could reach the saddle, the leaves parted close by and sir fidelis spake soft-voiced,

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;142;therefore, sir fidelis, do thou take the horse and what thou wilt beside and leave me here, for fain am i to end my days within these solitudes with no eye to see me more--save only the eye of god!"

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;142;so saying, beltane went aside, and sitting 'neath a tree beside the river, bowed his head upon his hands and groaned, then came sir fidelis full swift, and stooping, touched his bowed head with gentle hand, whereat he but groaned again.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;142;but, as to thee, take now the horse and ride you ever north and west--"

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;142;"the trees shall tell you this.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;142;but as beltane arose, sir fidelis incontinent turned away, and presently came back leading the great horse.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;143;and fidelis sighed in deep and troubled fashion and so fell to silence, what time beltane, cunning in wood-lore, glancing hither and thither at knotted branch and writhen tree bole, viewing earth and heaven with a forester's quick eye, rode on into the trackless wilds of the forest-lands.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;143;five weary days and nights wandered they, lost to sight and knowledge within the wild, days of heat and nights of pain and travail, until there came an evening when, racked with anguish and faint with thirst and weariness, beltane drew rein within a place of rocks whereby was a shady pool deep-bowered in trees.

moss;Bryophyta;organism;PG10064;144;thereafter, with much labour, beltane got him to earth, and fidelis brought him where, beneath the steep, was a shallow cave carpeted with soft moss, very excellent suited to their need.

fern;Polypodiopsida;organism;PG10064;144;here beltane laid him down, watching a little cataract that rippled o'er the rocky bank near by, where ferns and lichens grew, what time sir fidelis came and went, and, having set fire a-going whereby to cook their supper, brought an armful of fragrant heather to set 'neath beltane's weary head.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;144;up rose the moon, a thing of glory filling the warm, stilly night with a soft and radiant splendour--a tender light, fraught with a subtle magic, whereby all things, rock and tree and leaping brook, found a new and added beauty.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;144;"fidelis," says beltane, "on so fair a night as this, methinks, the old fables and romances might well be true that tell of elves that dance on moony nights, and of shapely nymphs and lovely dryads that are the spirits of the trees.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;145;now as he lay thus, after some while he heard a swift, light footfall, the whisper of mail, and knew that she stood above him, yet he heeded not, wherefore at last she spake, sweet-voiced and gentle.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;145;"when i waked from my swoon within the chapel at--at blaen, and found thee gone, i, distraught with woeful fear and a most strange sickness, took thy sword and therewith horse and armour and in that same hour fled from blaen, none knowing.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;146;so she mounted, whereat the mettled charger must needs rear, and beltane, staggering aside, catch at a tree and lean there.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;147;he came to me within the hollow six nights agone and gave to me his horse and bid me seek thee here.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;148;"aye, lord, he bade me take his horse that i might come to thee the sooner."

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;148;but when he shall be duke indeed, and blest with her that is so fair a maid and apt to motherhood--i pray thee, saint cuthbert, let him not forget me whose soul he saved long since within the green in the matter of beda that was a jester--i pray thee let him have regard to black roger that am his man henceforth to the end.

ling;Calluna vulgaris;organism;PG10064;149;it was black roger, praying in the dawn, his broadsword set upright in the ling, his hands devoutly crossed and his black head stooped full low, thus he saw not beltane's eyes upon him until his prayer was ended.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;149;"why, see you now, master, when our foes came not, and you came not, we sent word to belsaye that, within two days we would march thither, according to thy word, and forthwith giles sends word back that he was very well and wanted no long-legged walkyn or surly roger to share authority with him yet a while, and bid us twirl our thumbs within the green until he commanded our presence--with divers other ribald japes and wanton toys--whereon walkyn and i waxed something wroth.

heather;Calluna vulgaris;organism;PG10064;149;thereafter, stretched upon his bed of heather, beltane watches black roger gird on belt and quiver, and, bow in hand, stride blithely into the green, and, ere he knows it, is asleep.

ling;Calluna vulgaris;organism;PG10064;150;in so much that of a sudden he stealeth swiftly from the cave, and, drawing sword setteth it up-right in the ling, then kneeling with bowed head and reverent hands, forthwith fell to his prayers, after this wise,--

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;153;once and twice he circled, seeking a hold, then leapt he swift and low, arms and fingers clenched and locked, and beltane was bent, swayed, and borne from his feet, but even so, with a cunning twist he brake black roger's hold and staggered free.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10064;154;o bethink thee, lest she change thee into a swine, or black dog, aye, or even a small shrew-mouse--i've heard of such ere now--or blast thee with fire, or loathly disease, or--"

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;154;in a while cometh gloomy roger leading the destrier mars, whereon gloomy beltane swung to saddle, and, looking round about him once and twice, rode slowly towards where, beyond the shade of trees, the forest road ran north and south.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10064;154;chapter xlix how beltane found peace and a great sorrow it had been an evening of cloud, but now the sky was clear and the moon shone bright and round as they reached that desolate, wind-swept heath that went by the name of hangstone waste, a solitary place at all times but more especially wild and awful 'neath the ghostly moon, wherefore roger went wide-eyed and fearful, and kept fast hold of beltane's stirrup.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;155;"nay," answered beltane, checking his horse, "what was it?

owl;Strigiformes;organism;PG10064;155;"'twas an owl, roger."

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10064;155;so they began to cross the rolling desolation of the heath and presently espied a great boulder, huge and solitary, gleaming white and ghostly 'neath the moon.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;155;being come very nigh, beltane checked his horse and was about to dismount, when roger, uttering a sudden gasping cry, cowered to his knees, for in the air about them was a sound very sweet to hear--the whisper of lute-strings softly plucked by skilled and cunning fingers, and thereafter a man's voice, rich and melodious, brake forth into tender singing,and the words were these,--

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10064;155;o gentle moon, to-night unveil thy softest, tend'rest light where feet i love, so small and white, do bear my love to me!"

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10064;155;"nathless here's one that i must speak with," said beltane, slipping to earth and looking about him with wondering eyes, for the voice had seemed to come from the grass at his feet.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;156;each day, at morn and eve, came she with cates rare and delicate, and her gentle hands did woo my wound to health, the which indeed so swift grew well that i did feign divers pains betimes lest she should vanish from me quite--so grew my love.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;156;so did i, yestere'en, upon my knightly word, pledge her my troth, so shall she be henceforth my lady of alain and chatelaine of divers goodly castles, manors, and demesnes.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;156;a hurry of feet running swift and light, a rustle of flying garments, and there, flushed and panting, stood the witch-- the witch mellent that was the lady winfrida.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;156;now, beholding beltane, her eyes grew wide with swift and sudden fear--she quailed, and sank to her knees before him, and when sir jocelyn, smitten to mute wonder, would have raised her, she brake forth into bitter weeping and crouched away.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;157;so saying, beltane turned very suddenly, and strode out, where, beside the great horse mars, stood roger, very pale in the moonlight, and starting and staring at every rustling leaf and patch of shadow.

owl;Strigiformes;organism;PG10064;157;"roger," said he, "thou art afraid of bats and owls, yet, forsooth, art a wiser man than i. bring hither the horse."

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;158;and now, because of her proved innocence, he was uplifted by a great and mighty joy, and therewith his step was light and swift, anon, because of his base doubt of her, he writhed 'neath the sharp-gnawing tooth of bitter remorse, and therewith his step grew heavy and slow.

sole;Paraplagusia;organism;PG10064;159;"dost ever feel a tingling in the soles of thy feet?"

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10064;159;"master," quoth roger, glancing furtively about, "in my youth i did see a goodly man be-devilled by horrid spells by an ancient hag that was a noted witch, and he acted thus--a poor wight that was thereafter damnably be-devilled into a small, black rabbit, see you--"

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10064;159;but afterwards saw i the old woman with the black rabbit in a cage--wherefore the vile hag was stoned to death, and the black rabbit, that was her familiar, also--and very properly.

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10064;161;but who art thou dost bear such a name, and wherefore cower and gasp ye?"

jester;Symbrenthia;organism;PG10064;161;the eyes of beltane were wondrous gentle, his mouth sweet-curved and tender, the old harsh lines of grim-curled lip and lowering brow had vanished quite, and thus at last black roger saw again the face of my beltane that had smiled on him long since amid the green across the prostrate form of poor beda the jester.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;163;"but two days since in ermined robe and chain of office, a notable man, i, courted by many, feared by more, right well be-seen by all, with goodly horse betwixt my knees and lusty men-at-arms at my beck and call.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;165;but beltane was already descending the steep path leading down into the great green hollow that lay all silent and deserted 'neath the ghostly moon, where nought stirred in the windless air, where bush and tree cast shadows monstrous and distorted, and where no sound brake the brooding quiet save the murmurous ripple of the brook that flowed to lose itself in the gloomy waters of that deep and sullen pool.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;165;swift and sure-treading as only foresters might, they descended the steep, and lured by some elfin fancy, beltane must needs come to stand beside the pool and to stare down into those silent waters, very dark by reason of that great tree 'neath whose writhen branches tostig the outlaw had fought and died, so stood beltane awhile lost in contemplation, what time roger, drawing ever nearer his master's elbow, shivered and crossed himself full oft.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;165;aye--on the brow--'neath the tree!

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;165;then beltane turned whither roger's shaking finger had pointed, and strode beneath the great tree.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10064;165;something thudded heavily upon the grass and lay there, mute and rigid, while beltane, leaning upon his sword, stared down at that fell shape, and breathing the noxious reek of it, was seized of trembling horror, nevertheless he stooped, and reaching out a hand of loathing in the dimness, found the cord whereby it had swung and dragged the rigid, weighty thing out into the radiance of the moon until he could see a pallid face twisted and distorted by sharp and cruel death.

ling;Calluna vulgaris;organism;PG10064;166;so saying, beltane knelt upon the sward and folded reverent hands, whereupon roger, somewhat abashed, having set his sword upright in the ling as was his custom, presently knelt likewise, and clearing his throat, spake aloud in this fashion,

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;168;and even as they stared in wonder, a broad shield flashed, and knight and horse were gone.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10064;168;"nay, yonder was some arch-wizard, master--the man o' the oak, or hob-gob himself.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10064;168;said beltane, stooping for his sword, for indeed, plain and loud upon the prevailing quiet was the ring and clash of heavy armour, what time from the bushes that clothed the steep a tall figure strode, and the moon made a glory in polished shield, it gleamed upon close-vizored helm, it flashed upon brassart, vanbrace and plastron.

ling;Calluna vulgaris;organism;PG10064;169;then sprang grim roger, dagger aloft, but swifter than he, the knight's sword swung, flat fell that long blade on roger's bascinet, wielded by an arm so strong that roger, staggering aside, rolled upon the ling, and thereafter, sat up, round-eyed and fearful,

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10064;169;but swift came my beltane, glad-eyed and with arms out-flung in eager welcome.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;170;upon the stillness a sound that grew and grew--a whisper, a rustling as of strong wind in trees, and presently upon the high banks to north and east and west a great company appeared, horse-men and footmen, whose armour flashed 'neath the moon, while high o'er bascinet and helm rose deadly pike and ponderous lance, rank upon rank, a very forest.

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10064;171;now beholding her, sir benedict beckoned roger and bid him stimmon certain of his company, forthwith, and when roger hasted back with divers awestruck fellows at his heels, they stood staring, amazed to behold these two great knights humbly kneeling side by side to pray for the soul of her who, all her days, had been scorned of men as the witch jolette.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10064;171;chapter lv how they marched for winisfarne at peep of day the trumpets blew, and beltane, starting up from slumber, found the great camp all astir about him, the smoke of a hundred watch-fires rose up into the stilly air of morning and made a fragrant mist amid the trees beneath which armour glinted as guard relieved guard and the new-waked companies mustered under arms.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10064;171;and ever as the sun rose the bustle waxed and grew, with a coming and going about the fires where the morning meal was preparing, here a mighty furbishing of arms and armour, yonder a prodigious hissing and so-hoing where chargers and pack-horses were picketed, line upon line--goodly beasts that stamped and snorted and whinnied joyously--and everywhere was noise and cheer of talk and laughter, yet everywhere was method and a strict orderliness in all things, wherefore beltane's very heart sang within him.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10064;172;but here sir benedict fell to silence, walking with face averted and gaze bent towards the dewy grass, and quickened his steps until they were come nigh unto the camp.

ling;Calluna vulgaris;organism;PG10064;172;so presently came they into the midst of the camp, where, seated on the mossy ling, hungry and expectant, were many noble lords and gentle knights and esquires of degree, who, beholding sir benedict with beltane, rose up with one accord.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10064;172;here, sir john of griswold whose sire bare thy father's banner, wherefore griswold is ashes long since.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10064;173;forthwith down they sat together on the grass, all and sundry, and ate and drank and laughed and talked, insomuch that in brake and thicket near and far the birds carolled and chattered in pretty mockery.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;173;thus, within the hour, the trumpets brayed 'to horse' and all was seeming hurry and confusion, yet a confusion, this, governed by soldierly method, so that, ere long, horsemen were mounted and footmen in array what time beltane, bedight in goodly vizored casque, with lance and shield borne behind him, came where stood sir benedict beside a great and noble war-horse.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10064;173;now, reining in his eager beast, beltane looked upon that stern array, and as he looked his eye kindled and his heart swelled within him.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;173;thus saying, my beltane wheeled his horse, and with rhythmic ring and clash, together, rank on rank, horsemen and footmen, they followed hard behind, a silent, grim array, with eyes that gleamed 'neath helm and bascinet, and purposeful hands that griped full strong on lance and spear-shaft, as, coming to the forest-road, they swung away northwards towards winisfarne.

ram;Ovis aries;organism;PG10064;215;and presently, as beltane leaned thus, grieving and alone, cometh giles that way, who, pausing beside him, peered down where the besiegers, but ill-sheltered by battered mantlet and palisades, strove amain to bring up one of their rams, since the causeway across the moat was well-nigh complete.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;219;now came beltane and took the friar's hand.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10064;222;back and back the besiegers reeled before that raging fury--twice the white friar was smitten down yet twice he arose, smiting the fiercer, wherefore, because of his religious habit, the deathly pallor of his sunken cheek and the glare of his eyes, panic came, and all men shrank from the red sweep of his sword.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10064;226;far on the left showed the banner of his marshal sir bors, above his right battle flew the raven banner of sir pertolepe the red, and above his main battle rose his own standard-- a black lion on a red field.

leopard;Panthera pardus;organism;PG10064;226;and beholding their might and confident bearing, beltane clenched nervous hands and his mouth grew hard and grim, so turned he from this formidable host to where, just beyond the woods, his father's banner flew beside the leopards of mortain.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;227;but of a sudden duke beltane wheeled his horse, his sword flashed on high, whereat trumpets brayed and on the instant sir jocelyn wheeled off to the left, he and all his company, and gathering speed began to skirt duke ivo's advanced pikemen and archers, and so rode down upon those men of pentavalon who were drawn up against belsaye.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;228;so giles took the banner whiles beltane fitted on his great, plumed helm, thereafter comes roger with his shield and ulf leading his charger whereon he mounted forthwith, and wheeling, put himself at the head of his pikemen and archers, with roger and ulf mounted on either flank and giles bestriding another horse behind.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;229;and amid the blood and dust, in the forefront of that raging tumult, a torn and tattered blue banner rocked and swayed, where beltane with giles at his right hand led on his grim foresters, their ranks woefully thinned and with never a horse among them.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10064;230;now as they advanced, beltane beheld at last where, high above embattled walls and towers, rose pentavalon's mighty keep wherein he had been born, and, remembering his proud and gentle mother, he drooped his head and grieved, and bethinking him of his proud and gentle helen, he took fresh grip upon his sword, and lengthening his stride, looked where black ivo's broken columns, weary with battle, grim with blood and wounds, already began to ride 'neath the city's frowning gateway, while hard upon their straggling rearguard duke beltane's lion banner fluttered.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10064;233;soon were they free of the city and reaching that rolling down where the battle had raged so lately, beltane set his horse to a stretching gallop, and away they raced, over upland and lowland until they beheld afar to their right the walls and towers of belsaye.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10064;236;betimes they crossed the marches into mortain, but it was late evening ere they saw at last the sleepy manor of blaen, its white walls and steepy roofs dominated by its one square watch-tower, above which a standard, stirring lazily in the gentle air, discovered the red lion of pentavalon.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;22;it was a quite natural proceeding, for jack was a wild sort, and he was probably gambling away all the gold that was dug in his mines.

miner;Geositta;organism;PG10066;24;he saw little sheet-iron stoves with the tin dishes piled, unwashed, upon the tops of them when the miners rushed back to their work, broken handles of picks and shovels, worn-out shirts and overalls lay where they had been tossed, here was a flat strip of canvas supported by four four-foot poles and without shelter at the sides, and the belongings of one careless miner tumbled beneath this miserable shelter, another man had striven for some semblance of a home and he had framed a five-foot walk leading up to the closed flap of his tent with stones of a regular size.

miner;Geositta;organism;PG10066;24;the first thing he saw was a man dressed as a cowpuncher from belt to spurs--spurs on a miner--but above the waist he blossomed in a frock coat and a silk hat.

sombrero;Ratibida columnifera;organism;PG10066;24;he walked, or rather staggered, on the arm of an equally strange companion who was arrayed in a white silk shirt, white flannel trousers, white dancing pumps, and a vast sombrero!

sombrero;Ratibida columnifera;organism;PG10066;24;a big fellow stepped from the bar, his sombrero pushed to the back of his head, his shirt sleeves rolled to the elbow away from vast hairy forearms.

miner;Geositta;organism;PG10066;25;at this the bartender chuckled, and the miner showed his teeth in his disgust.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10066;25;he looked ruefully at the palms of his hands which were as tender as the hands of a woman.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;25;"heard a fellow say that jack landis was a good sort to work for--didn't rush his men none.

catamount;Puma concolor;organism;PG10066;25;"sufferin' catamounts!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;26;"but how," pondered donnegan, "can i be working for lord nick when i sign up to work under jack landis?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;26;she had not even asked why he did not bring her straight to jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;26;no doubt that spirit of evil had foreseen all this, and he knew that every moment spent with the girl would drive donnegan on closer to the accomplishment of the colonel's great purpose--the death of jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;26;for the colonel, as jack's next of kin, would take over all his mining interests and free them at a stroke from the silent partnership which apparently existed with lord nick and lester.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;26;one bullet would do all this,and with jack dead, who else stood close to the girl?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;26;he was glad when the time came and he could tell her that he was going down to the corner to find jack landis and bring him to her.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;27;her hatred could be a deathless passion, and her love also, and the great question to be answered now was, did she truly love jack landis?

coyote;Canis latrans;organism;PG10066;27;once, in one of those hushes which will fall upon every crowd, he heard a coyote wailing sharply and far away, as though the desert had sent out this voice to mock at the corner and all it contained.

mule;Equus mulus;organism;PG10066;27;a mule had kicked lewis in the chin, and a great white welt deformed his lower lip.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;27;"i want to see jack landis," he said.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;and donnegan saw the flushes of liquor, and heard the loud voices of happy fellows who had made their "strikes", but in all that brilliant crew he had no trouble in picking out jack landis and nelly lebrun.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;height without clumsiness, bulk and a light foot at once, a fine head, well poised, blond hair and a grecian profile--such was jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;but in big jack landis there was patently a great deal of the unaffected child.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;he saw the dancers pause and scatter as the music ended, saw them drift to the tables along the edges of the room, saw the scurry of waiters hurrying drinks up in the interval, saw nelly lebrun sip a lemonade, saw jack landis toss off something stronger.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;and then donnegan skirted around the room and came to the table of jack landis at the very moment when the latter was tossing a gold piece to the waiter and giving a new order.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;he came behind the chair of the tall master of the corner, and while nelly lebrun stopped her glass halfway to her lips and stared at the ragged stranger, donnegan was whispering in the ear of jack landis,

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10066;28;then, with a careless shrug of distaste, he drew out a few coins and poured them into donnegan's palm, the latter pocketed them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;jack landis rose from his chair, and it was not until he stood so close to donnegan that the latter realized the truly herculean proportions of the young fellow.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;"she's in the corner," said donnegan, and he dwelt upon the face of jack landis with feverish suspense.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;28;plainly, it was not the most welcome news that jack landis had ever heard.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;29;jack landis trembled under the glance, yes, he was deeply in love with the girl.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;29;and donnegan watched her face shade with suspicion, stiffen with cold anger, warm and soften again under the explanations of jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;29;she was laughing with the newcomer as though nothing troubled her at all, but over his shoulder her glance probed the distance and followed jack landis.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10066;29;she wanted to see the messenger again, the man who had called her companion away, but in this it was fox challenging fox.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10066;29;outside landis shot several questions at him in swift succession, he wanted to know how the girl had happened to make the trip.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10066;29;if she loved the man he, donnegan, would let him live, if she did not love him, he, donnegan, would kill him like a worthless rat under heel.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10066;29;he looks like a shifty little rat to me."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;29;"he's big enough, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;30;"can't you guess, jack?"

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10066;30;the girl interrupted while donnegan still had control of his hair-trigger temper.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;30;"you forget, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;30;at this jack landis burst into an enormous laughter.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;30;"i'm tired out, it's been a hard ride, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;30;"you can't lie across the entrance to my tent and guard me, jack.

cat;Felis;organism;PG10066;30;"he doesn't look capable of protecting a cat!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;31;run along, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;31;"good night, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;31;if jack landis had hurt her like this--if she loved him so truly--then jack landis she should have.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;31;though jack landis were fixed as high as the moon he would tear him out of his place and give him to the girl.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;31;the calm eye and the smooth play of an obvious professional in a linen suit kept him for a moment at one table, looking on, then he went to the games, and after changing the gold which jack landis had given as alms so silver dollars, he lost it with precision upon the wheel.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;32;here was a man, harking back to nelly lebrun and her love of brilliance, who would probably win her preference over jack landis for the simple reason that he was different.

miner;Geositta;organism;PG10066;32;if it was not enough to ruin the miners it was at least enough to clean them out of ready cash and discontinue the game on that basis.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;32;at the door he found that the gambler, with his canvas sack under his arm, had turned to the right toward the line of saddle horses which stood in the shadow, and no sooner did he reach the gloom at the side of the building than he broke into a soft, swift run.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;he darted down the line of horses until he came to one which was already mounted.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;this donnegan saw as he followed somewhat more leisurely and closer to the horses to avoid observance.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;he made out that the man already on horseback was a big negro and that he had turned his own mount and a neighboring horse out from the rest of the horses, so that they were both pointing down the street of the corner.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;donnegan saw the negro throw the lines of his lead horse into the air.

runner;Elagatis;organism;PG10066;33;in exchange he caught the sack which the runner tossed to him, and then the gambler leaped into his saddle.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;suppose he were caught in the midst of a cheat, his play would be to break away to the outside of the building, shooting out the lights, if possible--trusting to the confusion to help him--and there he would find his horse held ready for him at a time when a second might be priceless.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;he waited neither to find his stirrups nor grip the reins firmly, but the same athletic leap which carried him into the saddle set the horse in motion, and from a standing start the animal broke into a headlong gallop.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10066;33;he waited neither to find his stirrups nor grip the reins firmly, but the same athletic leap which carried him into the saddle set the horse in motion, and from a standing start the animal broke into a headlong gallop.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;the moment he made sure that the gambler was heading for a horse, he increased his own speed.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;the horses, checking their gallops in unison, were softly dog-trotting down the street.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10066;33;go straight on, george, to the clump of trees beyond the end of the street.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;"it was a good hand you played," continued donnegan, taking note that of the many people who were now passing them none paid the slightest attention to two men riding on one horse and chatting together as they rode.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10066;33;15 before donnegan gave the signal to halt in a clear space where the starlight was least indistinct, they reached the center of the trees.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;33;"now keep on your horse and keep a little off to the side," went on donnegan, "and remember that if you try to give me the jump i might miss you in this light, but i'd be sure to hit your horse.

miner;Geositta;organism;PG10066;35;if you show your face in the corner again, some of those miners will spot you, and they'll dress you in tar and feathers."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;35;he made george go before him into the tent and take up the roll of bedding, and then, with george and the bedding leading the way, and donnegan leading the two horses behind, they went across the hillside to a shack which he had seen vacated that evening.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;35;and donnegan stood by while the big negro silently tended to the horses--removing the packs and preparing them for the night.

gorilla;Gorilla;organism;PG10066;35;and the fierceness was given point by a pair of arms of gorilla length, broad shoulders padded with rolling muscles, and the neck of a bull.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;36;16 his plan, grown to full stature so swiftly, and springing out of nothing, well nigh, had come out of his first determination to bring jack landis back to lou macon, for he could interpret those blank, misty eyes with which she had sat after the departure of landis in only one way.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;36;yet to rule even the hand of big jack landis would be hard enough and to rule his heart was quite another story.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10066;37;he intended to rise, literally phoenixlike, out of ashes.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10066;37;and the next morning, in the red time of the dawn, he sat drinking the coffee which george washington green had made for him and considering the details of the problem.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;37;to startle the corner, and thereby make himself attractive in the eyes of nelly lebrun, overshadowing jack landis--that was the thing!

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10066;37;"george, godwin taught you how to make coffee?"

cat;Felis;organism;PG10066;37;but when, after that, he came and leaned over donnegan's bunk, the master closed his eyes and kept on breathing regularly, and finally george returned to his own place--softly as a gigantic cat.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10066;37;"a talented man, george, but he knew nothing about coffee.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10066;38;he was a tolerably rough-appearing sort and he was backed by two of a kind.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10066;38;he stared past george, and behold, the man in the dressing gown still sat in quiet and sipped his coffee.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10066;38;the three looked from gloster to the shack, from the shack to donnegan, absently sipping his coffee, from donnegan to george, who stood exhibiting a broad grin of anticipated delight.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10066;38;and donnegan sipping his morning coffee fitted into the picture which rumor had painted.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;39;afterward, in order that he might think, donnegan got on one of the horses he had taken from godwin and rode over the hills.

chestnut;Castanea;organism;PG10066;39;they were both leggy chestnuts, with surprising signs of blood' and all the earmarks of sprinters, but in godwin's trade sharp getaways were probably often necessary.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10066;39;the pleasure he took in the action of the animal kept him from getting into his problem.

miner;Geositta;organism;PG10066;39;how follow up the opening gun which he had fired at the expense of gloster and the three miners?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;39;he broke off, later in the day, to write a letter to colonel macon, informing him that jack landis was tied hard and fast by nelly lebrun and that for the present nothing could be done except wait, unless the colonel had suggestions to offer.

miner;Geositta;organism;PG10066;39;milligan had even managed to bring in a few bottles of wine, and he had dispensed cheap claret at two dollars a glass when the miners wished to celebrate a rare occasion.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;39;among other things, he sold mint juleps, and it was the memory of the big sign proclaiming this fact that furnished donnegan with his idea.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;39;when they stop you, tell them you come from donnegan and that you have to get me some mint for a julep.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;39;so george mounted the horse and went.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;39;"i been sent for enough mint to make a julep."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;40;big george stepped from the doorway and mounted his horse.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;40;and among others, nelly lebrun with jack landis beside her.

chestnut;Castanea;organism;PG10066;40;he came on a prancing chestnut horse which sidled uneasily on a weaving course, as though it wished to show off for the benefit of the rider and the crowd at once.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;40;he came on a prancing chestnut horse which sidled uneasily on a weaving course, as though it wished to show off for the benefit of the rider and the crowd at once.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;41;george, get off your horse and go into milligan's place.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;41;i want that mint!"

snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10066;41;the hand of donnegan licked out as the snake's tongue darts--the loaded quirt slipped over in his hand, and holding it by the lash he brought the butt of it thudding on the head of andy.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;41;even then the instinct to fight remained in the stunned man, while he fell, he was drawing the revolver, he lay in a crumpling heap at the feet of donnegan's horse with the revolver shoved muzzle first into the sand.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;41;"go in and get that mint, george," he ordered.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;41;as for donnegan, his only movement was to swing his horse around and shift riding crop and reins into the grip of his left hand.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10066;41;he had been knocked down like a dog.

dog;Canidae;organism;PG10066;41;he had been knocked down like a dog.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;41;he came to the master and offered the mint, and donnegan, raising it to his face, inhaled the scent deeply.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;42;"but the mint!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;42;jack landis flashed a glance of suspicion down at her, but her dancing eyes had quite forgotten him.

hornet;Vespa;organism;PG10066;42;18 before milligan's the crowd began to buzz like murmuring hornets around a nest that has been tapped, when they pour out and cannot find the disturber.

hawk;Accipiter;organism;PG10066;42;she had been known to refer to him as a cowardly hawk of a man, but now she bullied the crowd in a shrill voice and made them bring water and cloth.

hawk;Accipitrinae;organism;PG10066;42;she had been known to refer to him as a cowardly hawk of a man, but now she bullied the crowd in a shrill voice and made them bring water and cloth.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;but in the background big jack landis was seriously trying to get to the firing line.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;"don't go, jack," she pleaded.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;she backed this appeal with a lifting of her eyes and a parting of her lips, and jack landis paused.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;"you won't go, dear jack?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;now, jack knew perfectly well that the girl was only half sincere.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;as for jack landis, his slow mind did not readily get under the surface of the arts of nelly, but he knew that there was at least a tinge of real concern in the girl's desire to keep him from the posse which milligan was raising.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;"why, jack, sometimes they call you the same thing, say that you hunt for trouble now and then!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;"jack, listen!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;"i tell you, jack, he'd kill you!"

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;43;but i saw his face when he lifted that mint.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;43;he was thinking of nothing but the scent of the mint.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;jack, you're a big man and a strong man and a brave man, and we all know it.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;43;she was seeing the calm face of donnegan as he raised the mint.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;and as though he understood, jack landis hardened.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;43;"jack is going," she said.

buzzard;Buteo;organism;PG10066;44;the moment i first saw his face i knew that he was meant for gun fodder--buzzard food!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;44;so jack landis strode up the hill first and foremost of the six stalwart men who wished to correct the stranger's apparent misunderstandings of the status of the corner.

snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10066;44;they found the shack wrapped in the warm, mellow light of the late afternoon, and on a flat-topped rock outside it big george sat whittling a stick into a grotesque imitation of a snake coiled.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;44;"lady," began someone, and then looked about for jack landis, who was considered quite a hand with the ladies.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;44;but jack landis was discovered fading out of view down the hillside.

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;45;the corner had had many things to talk about during its brief existence, but nothing to compare with a man who entered a shooting scrape with such a fellow as scar-faced lewis all for the sake of a spray of mint.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;45;it had been a clean-cut fight, and jack landis had won cleanly on his merits.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;45;to repay the sidelong glances which he met on every side, jack landis would have willingly crowded every living soul in the corner into one house and touched a match to it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;46;that was for lord nick, for that celebrated character was said to be as tall and as finely built as jack landis himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;46;besides, to lose jack landis would be to lose the most spectacular fellow in the corner, to say nothing of the one who held the largest and the choicest of the mines.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;46;what chance had poor jack landis against her?

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10066;46;before the evening was well under way, landis was making love to her openly, and nelly was in the position of one who had roused the bear.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;46;in any place other than the corner it would have been embarrassing long ago, and when jack landis, after a dance, put his one big hand over both of nelly's and held her moveless while he poured out a passionate declaration, nelly realized that something must be done.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;46;said jack landis, and with fierce intensity he watched the face of nelly lebrun.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;47;"jack, you're angry."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;47;but it's an interesting bluff, jack, don't you think?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;47;jack, i'll wager that there's something crooked about him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;47;jack landis thawed a little under this careless chatter.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;47;"why, jack, that's foolish.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;47;"i'll tell you why," jack replied.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10066;48;in the meantime both men and women gave donnegan the lion's share of their attention.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;48;she confined herself strictly to jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;48;she swung securely around the circle in the big arms of jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;48;and he saw only nelly lebrun and the broad shoulders of jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;48;in the meantime, nelly and jack were coming again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;48;he, jack landis, had actually been tagged while he was dancing with the woman which all the corner knew to be his girl!

mint;Mentha;organism;PG10066;49;it had all been to win her attention, from the fight for the mint to the tagging for the dance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;50;and even if you were to prove too much for jack you'd come against lord nick, as you say yourself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;50;21 as they went back, toward nelly's table, where jack landis was trying to appear carelessly at ease, the face of donnegan was pale.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;50;he heard the cool, precise voice of donnegan acknowledging the introduction, and then the red-headed man went back to his table, and jack landis was alone with nelly lebrun again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;50;"let's not talk about him, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;50;"you're acting like a two-year-old, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;50;"nobody's thinking about you at all, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;50;"i liked him well enough to introduce him to you, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;51;nelly lebrun was recalled by the heavy breathing of jack landis and she discovered that she had allowed her eyes to rest too long on the red-headed stranger.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;51;she had forgotten, her eyes had widened, and even jack landis was able to look into her mind and see things that startled him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;51;"you're right, jack," she said.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;51;when he turned, she saw him go back into the night with long strides, and within half an hour she knew, as clearly as if she were remembering the picture instead of foreseeing it, that jack and donnegan would face each other gun in hand on the floor of milligan's dance hall.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;51;still, she was not foolish enough to run after jack, take his arm, and make a direct appeal.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;51;it would be too much like begging for donnegan, and even if jack forgave her for this interest in his rival, she had sense enough to feel that donnegan himself never would.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;51;in his place there sat the pedlar and joe rix, they were members of lord nick's chosen crew, and since nick's temporary alliance with lebrun for the sake of plundering jack landis, nick's men were nelly's men.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;"it's jack landis!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;"what will lord nick say if he finds out you've let jack get into a fight?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;"you want us to keep jack from fightin', but you don't want us to hurt the other gent.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;"yes, yes, keep jack out of milligan's, but for heaven's sake don't try to put a hand on donnegan."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;22 to the people in milligan's it had been most incredible that jack landis should withdraw from a competition of any sort.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;for one and all they admitted that jack was imperiling his hold on the girl in question if he allowed her to stay near this red-headed fiend.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;but one and all they swore that jack landis had ruined himself with her by taking her away.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;the main point was that jack landis had backed down before a rival, and this fact was stunning enough.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;52;i think, sir, that jack landis is coming back."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;53;who started walkin' on jack's toes?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;53;by heck, i hope jack gets you!"

bulldog;Marcusenius macrolepidotus;organism;PG10066;53;he'll come here tonight and try to get at me like a bulldog straining on a leash.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;53;"i have just told mr. milligan that i am sure jack landis is coming back here to try to kill me.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;53;i intend to stay here and wait for him, jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;besides, where such men as donnegan and big jack landis were concerned, there was not apt to be much wild shooting.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;he, too, wished to turn and watch that door until it should be filled by the bulk of jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;and in the midst of this torturing suspense an idea came to him, and at the same instant jack landis entered the doorway.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;straight to the middle of the dance floor went jack landis, red-faced, with long, heavy steps.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;jack landis muttered a curse and said sneeringly,"are you afraid?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;"i'm going to kill you, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;"hark to him sing, jack, and we'll see that you get fair play."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;"let him take his try, jack."

bird;Aves;organism;PG10066;54;"that bird is the chief over again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;54;and breathlessly they waited for his proposal to jack landis.

gladiator;Mantophasmatidae;organism;PG10066;55;as well as a roman crowd if it wanted to see a gladiator die, the frayed nerves of the corner responded to the stimulus of this delightful entertainment.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;56;plainly they were not pleased with jack landis on this day.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;56;and yet you should be grateful to me for one thing, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;56;i hate a stiff action, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;57;but donnegan, sitting back with a smile, raised his own gun almost with leisure, unhurried, dropped it upon the mark, and sent a forty-five slug through the right shoulder of jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;57;it was a cruel one, for the bullet had torn its way through flesh and sinew, and for many a week the fighting arm of jack landis would be useless.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;57;for george had stood to one side and watched donnegan indomitably beat down the will of jack landis, and the sight would live in his mind forever.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;58;the work is done, the mines come to me as the heir of jack.

comma;Polygonia c-album;organism;PG10066;58;once more the colonel was checked, but this time the alteration in his face was no more than a comma's pause in a long balanced sentence.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;59;but for you, donnegan, how the devil do you benefit by having jack flat on his back, sick, helpless, and in a perfect position to excite all the sympathies of lou?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;59;i surrender the benefits of all my work for you and go to make sure that you do not lay your hands upon jack landis."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;60;i intend to own the mines, if not through the death of jack, then through a legal act signed by the hand of jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;60;i have told you that i shall not so much as raise the weight of a finger against jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;60;truly, if jack did not go mad under the strain he would be very apt to do as the colonel wished.

snake;Serpentes;organism;PG10066;60;well, donnegan, you must know that when she learns it was a bullet from your gun that struck down landis, she'll hate you, my boy, as if you were a snake.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;60;but if she knows that after all you were forced into the fight, and that you took the first opportunity to bring jack into my--er--paternal care--her sentiments may change.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;60;the next step, donnegan, is to bring jack landis to this house."

tiger;Puma concolor;organism;PG10066;60;bring him away from the tigers of lord nick's gang?

tiger;Parantica;organism;PG10066;60;bring him away from the tigers of lord nick's gang?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;61;"to go among those fellows, wild as they are, and bring jack landis away to this house."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;61;"it isn't jack?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;61;"it isn't jack that you've fought with?"

turkey;Meleagridinae;organism;PG10066;63;now, talk turkey, donnegan, or you're done!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;63;vaguely he realized that in some way, somehow, he must fulfill his promise to the girl and bring jack landis home.

wildcat;Felis silvestris;organism;PG10066;64;the true westerner avoids trouble, but cornered, he will fight like a wildcat.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10066;64;and he made a gesture with both of his palms turned up.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;65;they remember poor jack landis and they think--the whole crowd--"

bully;Sideroxylon;organism;PG10066;66;you see, i was not fool enough to think that you would--particularly notice a fighting bully."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;66;"was that your only reason for fighting jack landis?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;66;"her fiance had left her, her fiance was jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;67;"the sort of a girl who sees a hero in such a fellow as jack landis."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;67;"and jack is brave."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;67;"they made me--flirt with poor jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;67;"but jack would wake up and make a noise."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;67;"on a horse litter kept ready outside."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;68;"jack was not the man i should have faced.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;68;"i'm going to help you to take jack away," she said, "on one condition."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;68;"and he'll let jack stay with the girl and her father?"

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;68;in the hut on the hill, donnegan put george quickly to work, and with a door and some bedding, a litter was hastily constructed and swung between the two horses.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;68;"and jack landis?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;68;and the one path of lighter gray was the bed of jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;68;"jack!"

sleeper;Eleotridae;organism;PG10066;68;no sound, he made as if to enter, and then he heard the heavy breathing of the sleeper, apparently.

wildcat;Felis silvestris;organism;PG10066;69;skins of the lynx, cunningly matched, had been sewn together to make her a rug, and the soft fur of the wildcat was the outer covering of her bed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;69;he was fully as tall as jack landis, but he carried his height easily, and was so perfectly proportioned that unless he was seen beside another man he did not look large.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;72;he untethered her horse while he murmured an answer.

chestnut;Castanea;organism;PG10066;72;besides, as they swung up the road--the chestnut at a long-strided canter and nelly's black at a soft and choppy pace--the wind of the gallop struck into her face, nelly was made to enjoy things one by one and not two by two.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;74;a grim fear came to donnegan that he might have to attack nick in his own stronghold, for jack landis might already have been taken away to the lebrun house.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;84;i have only to roll my chair into the room and sit and smile at jack in order to send him into an hysteria of terror.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;84;he could distinguish no words, but he caught the murmur of lou's voice as she talked to jack landis, and it had that infinitely gentle quality which only a woman's voice can have, and only when she nurses the sick.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;85;to do what?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;85;jack landis was stricken with panic,he stammered in a dreadful eagerness of fear.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;85;"don't be afraid, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;85;but all at once she cast out her free hand toward him, while the other still cherished the weakness of jack landis.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;85;"you are keeping jack here--in peril--for my sake?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;85;"to keep you from needless lying," she said, "let me tell you that jack has told me everything.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;85;but as for me--i know everything, jack told me."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;85;"jack has told me."

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10066;86;so donnegan closed the door softly and turned away with ashes in his heart.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10066;87;and briefly he described how lord nick had gone up the hill, seen the colonel, come back, taken a horse litter, and gone up the hill again, while the populace of the corner waited for a crash.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;101;it brought the blood to the cheeks of nelly as she hurried down the hill, for she recognized the pain that was in it, and it occurred to her that if the girl was in love with jack landis she was strangely interested in donnegan also.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10066;102;lou macon, she decided, was just the sort of girl who would think jack landis an ideal.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;2;some days later he had been rescued by jack templeton, a young englishman, who had boarded the vessel off the coast of africa, seeking payment for goods he had sold to the mutinous crew.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;2;through gallant service frank and jack had won their lieutenancies.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;2;later lord hastings had assumed command of a submarine and had made jack his first officer and frank his second officer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;2;frank, though large for his age, looked small when alongside of jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;3;jack had served as a damper for his friend's anger and enthusiasm more than once.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;3;jack, because of his huge bulk and great strength, was, of course, harder to beat in a hand-to-hand struggle than was frank, but what the latter lacked in this kind of fighting, he more than made up in the use of revolver, rifle or sword.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;3;returning, frank and jack had gone home with lord hastings, where lady hastings had insisted that they remain quiet for some time.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;3;realizing that they could not hope to accompany lord hastings, and not wishing to remain idle longer, frank and jack had requested lord hastings to have them assigned on active duty at once.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;3;and this was the reason that frank chadwick and jack templeton found themselves aboard h.m.s. queen mary when she steamed out to the north sea on an evening in the last week of may, 1916.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;4;this was the situation, then, when the queen mary, with jack and frank aboard, steamed down the thames and out into the north sea to take up again her patrol of those waters, and there was nothing to warn those on board of the great battle that even now was impending and that was to result disastrously for great britain, even though the germans were to suffer no less.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;4;mess over, frank and jack made their way to their own quarters amidships.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;4;was jack's reply.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;4;"it does seem that they should have been caught," jack agreed, "but i guess admiral jellicoe, admiral beatty and the admiralty know what is going on."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;4;"you must have a little german blood in you, frank," said jack, with a smile.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;5;"i'm with you," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;5;and half an hour later, as the queen mary still steamed due east, frank and jack slept.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10081;5;the great searchlight forward lighted the water for some distance ahead, and aft a second light cast its powerful rays first to port and then to starboard.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;6;frank and jack, in their quarters, were awakened by the sounds of confusion above.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;6;all was dark and it was this that told frank and jack that something was going on.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;6;"no, it's not," returned jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;6;"if they hit us you won't know anything about it," was jack's response.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;6;jack, standing near the rail, heard something whiz by his head.

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10081;6;jack, standing near the rail, heard something whiz by his head.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;6;"right here, forward, sir," replied jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;6;the ship veered crazily, and at the some moment, frank, who was standing where jack had been a moment before, heard something swish past.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;at that moment jack stood close to the bridge.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;quickly jack sprang to obey.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;frank and jack leaped in after them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;"give way," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;close to the wreckage of the zeppelin it approached, and cries told jack that some of the germans still lived.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;near the wreckage jack gave the command to cease rowing.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;and at last jack counted fifteen germans who had been saved.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;jack commanded his men to row closer to the wreckage.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;jack scrutinized the wreckage closely.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;for answer jack arose in the boat.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;rapidly, jack swam close to the wreckage.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;"no," returned jack, "and i am rather afraid to swim under there.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;"lay hold of this end here," he said to jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;"better let me do it, frank," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;7;jack did as his chum requested and a moment later frank disappeared under the wreckage, diving first to make sure that he got under.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;a moment later he succeeded in making his way to where jack still tugged at the balloon.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;jack lent a hand and they dragged the german from beneath the wreckage.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;frank and jack clambered aboard.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;said jack, sharply.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;jack shuddered.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;jack and frank stood at the rail, gazing off toward the distant horizon, when the young man approached them.

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10081;8;jack and frank stood at the rail, gazing off toward the distant horizon, when the young man approached them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;his eyes rested on jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;"do," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;8;"well, if that's the way of it, you can count me in, of course," said jack.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;8;two hours later she slowed down a short distance from three other vessels, which proved to be the indefatigable , the invincible and the lion , the latter the flagship of vice-admiral beatty.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;9;"you're last on the card, jack," said frank, with a laugh, when they were informed of the manner in which the events were to be pulled off.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;9;"hope i'm last on my feet, too," said jack, with a laugh.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;9;"you won't be," said jack, positively.

crow;Euploea;organism;PG10081;9;"don't crow, we'll get you yet, reynolds," was captain raleigh's reply.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;10;jack, stripped to the waist and wearing a pair of trunks, had appeared on deck.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;10;jack caught sight of frank and smiled.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;10;captain raleigh, in the meantime, had approached jack and his seconds.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;10;jack was surprised.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;"why," said jack, in surprise, "i can hardly do that now, sir.

hawk;Accipiter;organism;PG10081;11;watch that right hand of his like you would a hawk."

hawk;Accipitrinae;organism;PG10081;11;watch that right hand of his like you would a hawk."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;"i shall remember, sir," replied jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;now for the first time the crew of the queen mary knew who jack's opponent would be, and after a look at harris, they became strangely silent.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;the others took up the cry and jack smiled.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;jack and harris nodded that they understood.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;jack, standing well above six feet, still was not as tall as his opponent, who topped him by a full inch.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;their arms were about of a length, but harris was big through the chest and his arms seemed more powerful than jack's.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;a close observer, however, would have seen that while jack was in perfect physical condition, harris carried a trifle too much fat--not much, but still a trifle.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;with the battle anywhere near equal, this fat might prove to jack's advantage.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;jack's arms showed strength, but the muscles were not knotted like those of harris.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;harris was perhaps twenty-eight years old, jack almost ten years younger.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;jack had the youth, but harris had the experience of many hard encounters.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;it appeared that the odds were heavily against jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;jack and harris sized each other carefully.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;jack smiled.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;"don't worry about me," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;jack leaped lightly backward even as harris aimed a vicious blow at his head, apparently trying to make good his word to end the battle at once.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;the blow missed jack's face by the fraction of an inch.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;harris followed up this blow with a right and left, which jack blocked neatly, and then brought his right up, trying to upper cut.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;jack leaped backward and the blow grazed his chin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;11;before harris could recover, jack stepped quickly forward and planted a sharp right and a hard left to harris' nose.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;it was first blood for jack and the crew of the queen mary sent up a wild cheer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;these two blows had given the indefatigable champion some respect for jack's ability.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;but jack had not been deceived and caught both blows upon his forearms.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;"and i may say the same," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;instead, jack lowered his guard and extended a hand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;now jack decided that he would feel the other out.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;in a moment jack realized what it was.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;had the blow been timed perfectly, jack realized, the fight would have been over then and there.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;guarding desperately, jack managed to fall into a clinch, where he hung on until his head cleared.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;"i'll be a little more careful of that right," jack confided to his seconds, as he again advanced into the ring.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;again harris tried to reach jack's chin, but this time jack blocked the blow.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;jack feinted three times, twice with his left and once with his right, and then the right crashed against harris' ear.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;the man staggered back and before he could recover jack planted two hard blows --right and left--to his sore nose.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;he circled around jack, lightly, dancing about on his toes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;jack blocked, but before he could recover, harris launched himself like a catapult and a series of right and lefts descended on jack's face, neck, ears and abdomen.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;jack staggered back and harris followed him closely, giving him no rest jack was still retreating at the bell.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;again in the third and in the fourth round jack seemed to be getting the worst of it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;but in the eighth jack again encountered harris' right and the force of the blow sent him reeling.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;all through the round harris followed up this advantage, and at the bell, it seemed that jack would be unable to continue the fight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;so, while harris was trying in vain to put in a finishing punch, jack husbanded his strength, determined to make a strong effort in the final round.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;the rest refreshed him still more, and as time was called for the tenth, jack cast discretion to the winds and leaped forward.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;12;jack was forced back around the ring by the force of this rush and backed against the ropes, but he bounded out with great force and landed a vicious left to the side of harris' jaw.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;as the referee parted them, jack saw the movement for which he had been watching.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;but it had not come too quick for jack, who was expecting it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;but, judging the distance exactly, jack moved his head a trifle to one side, and harris' fist flashed by his chin by the fraction of an inch.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;with all his force behind the blow, jack put a straight left to harris' jaw.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;a terrible jolt to the abdomen followed, and, as harris head came forward again, jack pivoted on his heel and struck with his right.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;with half a minute of the last round to go, jack had knocked the man out and won the day for the queen mary by a score of twelve to nine.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;quickly, jack pulled off his gloves and, leaning down, he picked up the unconscious man and carried him to his own cabin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;"i hadn't thought of that," was jack's reply.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;he rose from the bunk where jack had placed him and felt tenderly of his chin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;he extended a hand and jack grasped it heartily.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;"i am sure i hope so, too," returned jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;hardly had harris taken his departure when running feet approached jack's cabin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;before jack realized what was going on, they had seized him, hoisted him to their shoulders and rushed out on deck again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;jack flushed and hung his head.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;"i did the best i could," said jack, sheepishly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;frank now approached and accompanied jack back to their cabin, where jack got info his uniform.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;"i thought so myself," returned jack, with a grin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;13;jack's fight was the talk of the day aboard the queen mary , and aboard the indefatigable , too, for that matter.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;14;it was upon the following morning, while the queen mary steamed about in the north sea, that jack and frank embarked upon their first piece of work since they had been assigned to the giant battleship.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;14;asked captain raleigh, as he eyed jack, quietly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;14;jack did as commanded.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;14;jack passed the slip of paper back.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;14;"yes, sir," replied jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;14;"very well, sir," said jack, and waited to see if there were any further instructions.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;14;"pretty fine," jack agreed, raising his voice to make himself heard above the whir of the propellers and the noise of the engine.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;14;"where do we want to come down, jack?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;"i guess you are right, after all," jack agreed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;"can't see what the germans would be flying about here for," said jack,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;"well, i suppose they'll try it some day," said jack, "but not right away.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;"guess we may as well go down, then," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;"glad there is no sun," said jack, "it would be awfully hot down here."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;jack suddenly took frank by the arm.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10081;15;to ears less keen than the lad's the sound, which came from above, might have been some bird of the night flapping its wings as it soared overhead.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;but to frank and jack both it meant something entirely different.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;through his night glass jack scanned the clouds and at last he picked up the object for which he sought.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;so high in the air was the machine that it looked a mere speck and jack was unable to determine from that distance whether it was british or german.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;"see it, jack?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;15;jack assented.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;then jack said,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;jack scanned the eastern horizon with his glass.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;but jack had not been mistaken.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;and in this manner they overtook the hydroplane driven by frank and jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;jack, again surveying the horizon with his night glass, gave an exclamation.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;"this will do," said jack, leaning close to frank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;gradually the germans reduced the distance and at length the first plane was only a few yards behind the craft in which frank and jack were risking their lives.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;"little more speed, frank," called jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;"here's a good place for us to fall in line," jack instructed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;returned jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;"headed for the belgian or french coast, apparently," said jack to himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;"nearing our destination, wherever that is," muttered jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;jack gazed straight before him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;jack knew they were the lights of some town.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;16;jack leaned close to frank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;jack smiled to himself, for he knew that frank was telling the truth.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;"frank's all right if he can just keep his head," muttered jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;"probably ostend," jack told himself, "though why they should come this way is too deep for me."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;but jack was wrong, as he learned a short time later.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;jack and frank gazed about them quickly, for they believed, for the moment, that the germans had encountered a squadron of french airships.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;frank asked of jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;the others did likewise and a moment or so later they all came to earth in the center of what frank and jack could see was a small army camp, and as they alighted from their machines, the lads saw that it was an allied camp and not a german.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;"must be calais," said frank to jack in a whisper.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;"well, it looks like it," returned jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;at this one of the aviators raised a hand and the others gathered about him, frank and jack with them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;he waved a hand and the germans, for such jack and frank now knew them to be, separated.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;17;when the two lads were alone a moment later, jack said,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;18;chapter viii a startling discovery with the coming of midnight frank and jack returned to the spot where the aeroplanes had been parked.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;18;immediately the others--frank and jack among them--leaped into their machines and soared into the air.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;18;came a sudden cry from the machine nearest that of frank and jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;18;frank and jack, in their british hydroplane, went with them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;18;said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;18;frank and jack thanked their lucky stars that the night was very dark, for otherwise they would have been in imminent danger of being discovered, and each lad realized that it would go hard with them should their true identities be penetrated.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;19;again there was a subdued cheer, in which frank and jack joined for the sake of appearances.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;19;frank and jack, at this, slunk well back into the crowd, for they did not wish to be scrutinized closely.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;19;frank and jack walked a short distance toward the sea, but kept some distance behind the german leader, who stood looking off across the water, apparently deep in thought.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;19;echoed jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;19;"we don't want to let them sneak up on a part of our fleet unguarded, either," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;exclaimed jack, "you've laid out quite a job for us, haven't you?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;"then there must be no slip," said jack, quietly

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;"we'll have to wait until they're all asleep," said jack.

sleeper;Eleotridae;organism;PG10081;20;we should be able to do that without awakening the sleepers."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;jack and frank got to their feet

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;"careful," said jack as they separated.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;jack moved in the other direction.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;as jack came within a few yards of his prey, the man raised his rifle and commanded,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;"it's all right," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;"i wouldn't have minded it tonight," said jack, approaching closer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;he extended the pack to jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;jack accepted a cigarette.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;20;it was the moment for which jack had been waiting.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;a few moments later frank and jack met again near the first aeroplane.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;"it'll have to be quick work here," jack warned "we haven't a whole lot of time, you know."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;"now for the papers," said jack, as he straightened up after tinkering with the last machine.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;frank raised his revolver and would have brought it down on the man's head had not jack stayed him with a gesture.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;gently, jack thrust his hand into the german's pocket.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;as jack now made to get to his feet, he chanced to glance at the german he had just relieved of the papers.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;the man's eyes were open and gazed straight at jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;in his hand he held a revolver and it was levelled at jack's head.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;there was nothing for jack to do but obey or be shot.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;jack obeyed and the papers fluttered to his feet.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;jack made no reply, but a gleam of hope lighted up his eye, for, frank, chancing to turn for some unexplainable reason, had taken in the situation and was now advancing on tiptoe to his friend's aid.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;again jack made no reply, but none was necessary, for at that moment frank had come within striking distance.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;quickly, jack stooped and again recovered the papers he had taken so much pains to get.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;jack followed his friend across the sand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;jack needed no urging and a moment later the two boys were ready for flight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;and then, suddenly, there was the crack of a revolver behind them and a bullet flew close to jack's ear.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;21;cried jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;the aeroplane leaped skyward and started in pursuit of frank and jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;the two boys, believing that they were safe, were going along only at a fair rate of speed when jack's keen ears caught the sound of the pursuing machine.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;"well, they're coming, all the same," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;you'll have to bring him down, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;"i'll try," was jack's reply.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;jack fired, but with no better result.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;"no," said jack, "but neither did the other fellow."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;jack did so, but again the bullet went wild.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;once more the german fired and jack felt something whizz overhead.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;frank had no means of telling what plan jack had in mind, but he did not hesitate.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;it was what jack had expected.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;standing up in his precarious position, jack took a snap shot at the pilot as the german craft swept by.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;shouted jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;"no, he won't," said jack, "he's still going down."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;shouted jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;22;in the darkness, it was hard for the lads to tell just how badly the craft was damaged and whether it would float, but jack's idea was to be on the safe side.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;with the craft riding the swell of the waves, jack picked up the enemy with his night glass.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;jack gave the position to frank, and the hydroplane approached the foe slowly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;"no, nor we can't spot them, which makes it worse," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;jack fired but without result and then frank fired again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;said jack, "you must have got them both.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;"got me," he called to jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;jack levelled his revolver and fired rapidly at the enemy.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;"they tricked us, all right," said jack, as he reloaded.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;"we've got to get them, some way," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;23;"there's nothing sure about anything," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;"no use," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;gently, jack lowered himself over the side of the hydroplane, first divesting himself of his coat and shoes, then struck out for the disabled aeroplane.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;the distance was not great and a powerful swimmer, such as jack, could cover it easily in a few moments.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;jack did not approach the enemy craft from the front.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;there was not a sound aboard the aeroplane as jack drew close to it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;jack made a careful inspection of the disabled plane.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10081;24;without taking time to consider it, he sprang suddenly to the side of the plane and leaped into the water and with swift and powerful strokes struck out for his own craft.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;jack had hit upon the solution of the desertion of the german aeroplane.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;even as jack had lowered himself from the hydroplane and swam across the water, the germans in the other craft had done the same thing.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;jack, in making a wide detour as he approached the foes' machine, must have passed the two germans in the water.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;now, realizing that the germans must be close to the hydroplane, had they not already reached it, and remembering that frank was wounded, jack felt a sudden dread steal over him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;neither was as swift a swimmer as jack, and for that reason, their progress through the water had been considerably slower.

swift;Apodidae;organism;PG10081;24;neither was as swift a swimmer as jack, and for that reason, their progress through the water had been considerably slower.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;frank was still guiding the plane about occasionally to avoid a chance bullet from the enemy, but at the moment the germans came close, he had stopped the craft and was peering into the darkness, straining his ears for the sound of a struggle that would tell him jack was engaged with the enemy.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;suddenly a sound came to his ears from across the water, but it was not what he expected, although it was in jack's voice,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;"hurry, jack!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;24;jack needed no urging.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;jack, at this moment, was within a few yards of the boat.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;at the same instant, jack, unmindful of danger that might lurk aboard and thinking only of frank's danger, laid hold of the plane and climbed aboard.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;jack, with his feet wide apart and arms extended, braced himself to receive the shock, and when it came he was ready.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;as the first german sprang, jack met him with a straight right hand blow to the face and the man reeled back.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;the second, seeing the fate of his companion, dived for jack's legs and seized them, pulling the lad down.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;jack felt out with his left hand and encircled the german's neck.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;jack saw it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;jack, very angry, rose to his feet, stooped over, and picking up the german as though he had been a child, heaved him overboard.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;but jack, not realizing the import of frank's words, remained still.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;wheeling abruptly, the lad saw the german whom he had first knocked unconscious facing him with levelled revolver--the weapon was jack's own, which he had left behind when he swam to the enemy's aeroplane.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;but jack, with a few drops of blood trickling from his ear, suddenly became very angry.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;25;in spite of the fact that the revolver was pointed right at him, and that only a few feet away, jack took a quick step forward.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;jack swerved a trifle.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;jack's powerful left hand seized his wrist and twisted the revolver from it then, still grasping the wrist, the lad wheeled on his heel.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;he was lifted high in the air and, as jack gave a jerk and then released his hold, the man went sailing through the air and dropped into the sea with a loud splash.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;jack sat down.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"that settles that," said jack, briefly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;jack continued.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"well, i just wanted to know," said jack, "because here comes a german torpedo boat."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"we won't unless you hurry," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"one of 'em won't," said jack, grimly, "and i feel pretty safe about the other, too.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;demanded jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"if we don't get out of here pretty quick," said jack, quietly, "we won't get out at all."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;jack gazed toward the vessel.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"they're coming after us, frank," said jack, "a whole boatload of 'em.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"five minutes," he answered jack's question.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"five minutes is liable to be too late," returned jack, measuring the distance to the rapidly approaching german boat with his eye.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"three quarters of a mile," replied jack, calmly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;"well, they'll get us if you keep talking and don't get a move on there," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;26;let her go then," said jack, calmly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;even while jack was speaking, the hydroplane began to move slowly over the surface of the water.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;jack picked up his cap and waved it at the germans.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;again jack waved his cap.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;said jack, quietly, "i wouldn't have lost that cap----" he gazed at it as it floated in the water.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;jack glanced down into the water.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;"i couldn't have done it," returned jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;"it just goes to show," said jack, slowly, "that even fate sometimes works on the side of the right."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;cried jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;chapter xii the boys give the warning one other adventure, it transpired, was to befall frank and jack before they found themselves once more aboard the british battleship, queen mary , and while it did not result seriously, both lads once more approached the very door of death.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;the morning sun was well above the horizon when jack, shading his eyes, made out in the distance a smudge of smoke.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;27;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;"don't worry, they won't get very far," said jack, confidently.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;"look out, jack!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;jack had not realized that there was anything wrong and now he did not grasp the full significance of frank's words.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;what jack thought frank meant was that he was going to glide down to the deck of the battleship.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;his first thought had been to jump after crying out to jack, but seeing that his friend had not understood, frank stuck to his post, trying as well as he knew how to bring the plane to the sea as gently as possible.

turtle;Testudines;organism;PG10081;28;after remaining upon a level keel for one single instant, the hydroplane turned turtle.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;jack uttered a cry of alarm as he felt himself being hurled into space, for he had not realized what was about to happen.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;in falling, jack was thrown clear of the machine, which struck the water with a great splash.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;jack, when he came up from below, had thought first of frank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;28;jack stayed below until he could stand it no more, then rose to the surface.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;jack uttered an exclamation of relief and lay still, resting from his exertions.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;frank and jack clasped hands when they stood on deck and jack exclaimed,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;"i guess it was the way we went at it," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;jack looked at his companion in the greatest surprise.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;"well, it wasn't," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;"perhaps i didn't either," said jack, "but i've got more sense than to show it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;he asked of jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;jack picked up his cap and also moved toward the door of the cabin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;frank and jack hurried after him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;29;"if you please, sir," said jack, "i shall skip the details until later.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;30;jack returned his watch to his pocket.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;30;the queen mary , which had been heading southward after frank and jack returned aboard, was quickly brought about.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;30;after several sharp commands to his officers, captain raleigh motioned to frank and jack.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;30;"get the lion quickly," he ordered the wireless operator.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;30;" lion!

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;30;lion !"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;30;still in the wireless room, captain raleigh turned to frank and jack and said,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;30;jack explained as briefly as possible.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;30;captain raleigh interrupted occasionally as jack proceeded with his story and when the lad had concluded, he said quietly,

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;30;"admiral beatty, aboard the lion , calling, sir."

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;31;the operator obeyed and heard the operator aboard the lion repeat his message.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;31;come, boys," this last to frank and jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;31;frank and jack stood at attention.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;31;jack sprang to obey and in a moment the first officer of the queen mary was in the cabin.

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10081;31;"destroyers fortune and shark , sir," reported the operator a little later.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;31;captain raleigh motioned frank and jack to follow him and left the room.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;31;frank and jack were considerably flattered by this.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;32;jack stood at attention in captain raleigh's cabin as the commander of the queen mary again plunged into a mass of charts.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;32;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;32;"we'll lick 'em, sir," said jack, enthusiastically.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;32;jack followed him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;32;followed by jack, his first and second officers, captain raleigh made an inspection of the giant battleship.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;32;shortly after five o'clock frank and jack found themselves alone in their cabin, having been relieved of duty for an hour.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;32;"it's going to be a great fight, frank," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;32;"to my mind it is foolish to engage the german fleet with only a few ships," said jack.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;32;and even at that moment the same plan was being revolved in the mind of vice-admiral beatty as, in his flagship, the lion , he steamed swiftly northward.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;33;directly an aide was despatched for frank and jack, who made their way to their commander's quarters.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;33;exclaimed captain reynolds, when his eye fell on jack, "this lad is one of the two who gained this important information, eh?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;33;jack repeated the account of the adventures he and his friend had had the night before.

tiger;Puma concolor;organism;PG10081;33;so, then, is the edinsburgh , the tiger , the peerless , the terror , the george iv and the richard ?"

tiger;Parantica;organism;PG10081;33;so, then, is the edinsburgh , the tiger , the peerless , the terror , the george iv and the richard ?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;33;captain raleigh and jack made their way to the wireless room.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;34;"funny," said captain raleigh to jack, "they should have sighted the enemy by this time."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;34;"it would seem so, sir," agreed jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;34;captain raleigh asked of frank and jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;34;"but i am afraid it won't happen," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;34;"but he is not an englishman, sir," said jack with a smile.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;34;"american," was jack's reply.

crow;Euploea;organism;PG10081;34;from the reef of heligoland, the main german base in the north sea, to jutland, is about one hundred miles as the crow flies.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;35;jack glanced at his watch and as he did so eight bells struck.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;35;"and no aid for at least three hours," said jack, quietly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;35;"yes, but only one gone," replied jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;36;"about time to begin our retreat then," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;36;"right," agreed jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;36;"we will have to hold them," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;36;"and that settles the glasgow ," said jack, sadly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;36;"so it would," said jack.

torpedo;Torpedo;organism;PG10081;37;torpedo boats, more than a score of them, also spread far on either side.

torpedo;Torpedo;organism;PG10081;37;directly behind the single dreadnaught and the battleships came a flotilla of submarines, ready to dash forward at the proper moment and launch their deadly torpedoes.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;37;it was the lion , the flagship of vice-admiral beatty, steaming at full speed ahead.

black prince;Rohana parisatis;organism;PG10081;37;this left the black prince and the warrior alone before the larger british vessels and they stood to their work gallantly.

black prince;Rohana parisatis;organism;PG10081;37;above the black prince the zeppelin paused.

black prince;Rohana parisatis;organism;PG10081;38;when it had cleared the black prince was gone!

torpedo;Torpedo;organism;PG10081;38;with a view to disposing of the enemy immediately, captain raleigh ordered that one of the two forward torpedoes be launched.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;38;at this moment vice-admiral beatty and his flagship, the lion , entered the battle.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;38;rather than sacrifice more lives and ships, vice-admiral beatty, on the lion , gave the signal to retire.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;frank and jack, as well as all others on the queen mary , gazed in that direction.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;39;chapter xvii the main fleet arrives it was by a miracle, it seemed, that the queen mary, the indefatigable , the marlborough and the lion , now in the front line, had escaped being struck in their vitals by the german shells that flew all about.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;frank and jack had been working like demons.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;jack, in the forward turret of the queen mary a moment later, was hurled to the deck as a german shell struck one of the guns and blew it to pieces.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;jack sprang to one of the guns himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;jack forgot all about reporting to captain raleigh for further orders, and as the battle raged, he continued to fire one of the big 16-inch guns--he and other unwounded british tars.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;frank had not seen his chum for an hour, and chancing to poke his head into the forward turret, he was surprised to see jack working like a trojan with the members of the gun crew.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;"good work, jack!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;jack looked in frank's direction long enough to wave his hand, then turned back to his work.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;39;demanded jack of the man next him, shouting at the top of his voice to make himself heard above the din of battle.

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10081;39;they were the tipperary , the turbulent , the nestore and the shark .

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;39;there now remained facing the entire german fleet the lion , the queen mary , the indefatigable , the marlborough and two torpedo boats, the fortune and the alcaster .

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;40;absolutely uncontrollable now, the marlborough drifted toward the lion , with which she almost collided before the lion could get out of the way.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;40;now there were only three british ships in line--the lion , the queen mary and the indefatigable --and these were really not fit nor able to continue the fight.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10081;40;he strode up and down angrily, beating the palm of one hand with a knotted fist.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;41;a moment later the big german ships began to come about, and from the decks of the queen mary , the lion and the indefatigable there came loud british cheers.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;41;jack had relinquished his duties in the gun turret to more experienced hands and had joined frank on deck.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;41;"looks that way," jack agreed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;41;"pretty hard to beat a fellow when the elements are fighting on his side," jack admitted.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;41;but jack was wrong, though, as it turned out, it would have been a great deal better for all concerned if the chase had been abandoned at that point.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;41;said jack, grinning in the darkness that enveloped them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;42;"just the after effects of the battle," said jack, quietly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;42;declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;42;"i'm waiting," said jack, cheerfully.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;42;there was so much force behind frank's words--the lad seemed in such deadly earnest--that jack grew alarmed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;42;instinctively, frank threw out a hand and grasped jack by the arm.

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10081;42;so great was the force of the shock that frank, standing on the far side, was thrown clear over the rail.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;42;but the lad's grasp upon his chum's arm was so tight that it dragged jack along with him, and the two boys fell into the sea together.

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10081;42;the crews stampeded for the rails, but at the rails they hesitated, for they did not wish to throw themselves into the great unknown.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;43;when frank and jack had felt themselves in the water, the latter, realizing immediately what would happen if the ships sank before they had put some distance in between them, struck out swiftly toward what he felt to be the south, giving frank a hand as he did so.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;43;"i'm all right, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;43;"all right," said jack, "but keep close beside me.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;43;"and it is only a miracle that prevented us from going with them," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;43;suddenly jack's hand came in contact with something in the darkness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;43;jack looked at the other man in the water and uttered an exclamation of pleasure.

black prince;Rohana parisatis;organism;PG10081;43;cruisers lost included the defense , of 14,600 tons, the black prince , of 13,550 tons, and the warrior , of 13,550 tons.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10081;43;the giant battle cruiser marlborough, of 27,500 tons, had been badly damaged, as had the lion and other vessels.

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10081;43;the destroyers tipperary, turbulent, nestore, alcaster, fortune, sparrow hawk, ardent and shark had been sunk.

hawk;Accipiter;organism;PG10081;43;the destroyers tipperary, turbulent, nestore, alcaster, fortune, sparrow hawk, ardent and shark had been sunk.

sparrow;Passer;organism;PG10081;43;the destroyers tipperary, turbulent, nestore, alcaster, fortune, sparrow hawk, ardent and shark had been sunk.

hawk;Accipitrinae;organism;PG10081;43;the destroyers tipperary, turbulent, nestore, alcaster, fortune, sparrow hawk, ardent and shark had been sunk.

sparrow;Ammodramus;organism;PG10081;43;the destroyers tipperary, turbulent, nestore, alcaster, fortune, sparrow hawk, ardent and shark had been sunk.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;44;jack and frank, struggling in the water where they had been hurled by the collision of the queen mary and the indefatigable , were glad of the company of harris, who had bobbed up so suddenly alongside of them in the darkness.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;44;harris greeted jack's exclamation of surprise with a grin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;44;"well, you know as much about it as i do," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;44;but jack made out a few moments later, some distance to the east, what appeared to be a ship of some sort.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;44;"it's probably a german, anyhow," said jack, "so if we are rescued it will be only to be made prisoners."

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10081;44;"that's better than being made shark bait," said harris, "and, by the way, speaking of sharks, i have heard that there were many of them in these waters."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;44;"and so do i," agreed jack.

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10081;44;"i've got a knife," said harris, "but i am afraid i wouldn't know what to do with it should a shark get after me."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;44;"it's a german all right," said jack, regretfully.

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10081;44;"that talk of shark a while back made me feel sort of squeamish.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;45;"something wrong," said jack, quietly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;45;jack raised his voice in a shout.

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10081;45;officers shouted hoarse commands and struck out with the flat of their swords as members of the crew rushed for the rails.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;45;giant waves leaped in the direction taken by jack, frank and harris.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;jack and harris took in the situation quickly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;it was then that jack exerted himself to the utmost.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;cried jack, again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;then i'll see what i can do for you," replied jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;with this the germans were forced to be content, for they realized that jack held the upper hand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;jack called a consultation.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;"and yet they would not have helped us a short time ago," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;"no, he's not," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;"all right," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;"sit in the back, there," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;"now," said jack, "i'll tell you where we stand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;"no time to waste," said jack, briefly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;jack looked in the direction of this sound.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;"ship your oars, men," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;46;said jack, sharply.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;jack stood up in the boat and stepped forward.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;jack wasted no further time in words.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"harris," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"bandage him up as well as you can and give him a few drops of that water," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;for his part, jack stooped over the german soldier he had so recently knocked unconscious and raised him to a sitting posture.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"a drop of water here, too," said jack, quietly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"but this man must have a little," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;harris did not protest further and jack allowed the german soldier to moisten his tongue.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"take the helm, frank," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"harris," said jack, "i want you to stand guard over these sailors for a few minutes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"i guess not," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"but one of us must always be looking," said jack, quietly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;jack moved to the side of the german who had been the last to get into the boat.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;"i see," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;exclaimed jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;47;you have had an experience few can boast of," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;"now," said jack, "perhaps you can tell me the nearest way to shore."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;said jack, "we've got to make it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;"that's true enough," agreed jack, "but i have a feeling i was not born to be drowned.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;"can't help that," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;"that's what we thought before," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;"thanks," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;harris, at that moment, in spite of jack's warning, had been gazing across the sea absolutely unconscious of his surroundings.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;he knew that jack must have heard frank's cry of warning.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;he knew that he would get all the assistance it was in jack's power to give, and he felt that if jack were unable for any reason to aid him he must, nevertheless, give a good account of himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;48;meanwhile, jack had leaped forward, crying to frank as he did so,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;jack reached harris' side and together the two faced the three germans.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;"men," said jack, quietly, "unless you return to your oars immediately, we shall be forced to throw you overboard."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;with a cry, jack stooped down quickly and seized the man's wrist even as the point of the weapon would have been buried in harris' back.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;cried jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;exclaimed jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;jack heard his friend's cry.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;with a cry to harris, jack leaped over the side.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;even as jack came abreast of the struggling figures, frank threw up his hands and the two disappeared from sight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;jack, greatly alarmed, dived after them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;keeping his fingers clenched tightly in frank's coat--that the lad might not be drawn under again jack aimed carefully at the face of the german, which now was close to him, and struck out with all his strength.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;by the force of the impact as the blow landed jack knew that the german would trouble them no more.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;jack clambered over after him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;both of the latter wielded knives and it was plain to jack that harris hesitated to come to close quarters with them, as he had no assistance at hand, for he realized that, should he be overcome, the men would have little trouble of disposing of frank and jack, as they tried to climb back in the boat.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;but now that jack was able to come to his assistance again, harris made ready for a spring.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;jack saw this move and called,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;harris stayed his spring and jack again advanced to his side.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;jack's face was white and his clothing was dripping water.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;jack and harris advanced as slowly after them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;49;cried jack, again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;suddenly one of the germans sprang forward and aimed a vicious blow at jack with his knife.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;the move had been so unexpected, retreating as the men had been, that jack was almost caught off his guard.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;he went over the side of the boat, uninjured, but for the moment unable to lend jack a hand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;with two foes before him, jack realized there was not a moment to be lost.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;at the same instant, harris, who was just climbing back into the boat, uttered a cry of warning and jack turned just in time to dodge a knife thrust aimed at him by the second german.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;with only a single enemy before him, a smile broke over jack's face.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;but if he had such a thought in his mind, he discarded it, he sprang at jack, fiercely.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;again jack avoided the thrust of the knife and caught the stabbing wrist in his right hand.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10081;50;"you murderous dog!"

dog;Canidae;organism;PG10081;50;"you murderous dog!"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;jack and harris now approached frank's side and the former bent over him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;he smiled as jack asked him how he felt, and asked,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;"you bet," returned jack, then turned to harris.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;"be ready to jump in the moment a head appears," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;"i guess it's no use," said jack, slowly, at last.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;all through the afternoon jack and harris had rowed untiringly, but with the coming of nightfall there was no land in sight.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;50;"nothing to do but keep pulling in the same direction," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;"all right, then," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;protested jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;"suit yourself," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;"don't know where we are," said jack to harris, "but it seems to me we should raise land with the coming of daylight."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;"you bet," agreed jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;jack gave a sigh.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;"in that event," said jack, "we shall give our paroles until we reach shore."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;51;the officer saluted and motioned for jack, frank and harris to follow him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;52;"no reason why we shouldn't be," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;52;said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;53;"you should have known you couldn't convince him," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;53;he called jack's attention to the man, and the latter, seeing that he was the subject of discussion, quickly withdrew.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;53;"and so have i," jack declared.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;53;even on the third day of june, 1916, when the german warship on which jack, frank and harris were prisoners steamed into bremen the port was alive with activity.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;53;"several reasons, i guess," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;53;"we shall be glad to see it, whatever it may be," replied jack, courteously.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;53;exclaimed jack, in the utmost surprise.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;53;"nor i," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;"well, we're obliged to you for showing us the deutschland , at all events," said jack, "and i want to say that if by any chance she does reach the united states you may be well proud of her."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;"pretty tough, jack," said frank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;"i've no doubt of that," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;jack turned to frank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;exclaimed jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;what jack might have replied frank never learned, for at that moment another german officer accosted them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;he was the man who was so strangely familiar to jack and frank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;the officer who was to conduct the three prisoners to berlin tapped jack on the shoulder.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;54;"we're ready now," returned jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;55;he took a seat beside jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;55;as the automobile started down the street, jack glanced at his captor sharply.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;55;"deuced uncommunicative sort of a fellow," said jack to himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;55;then, walking close to frank and jack, he said quietly,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;55;"i know i have seen you some place," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;55;"and mine," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;55;"well, i don't hardly know what to think of it," jack replied.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;55;"come now, don't get mad, frank," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;56;"nor i," admitted jack, "though, as you say, there is something familiar about him."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;56;"well," said jack, "i'm not as credulous as you are, frank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;56;"if he was telling the truth," said jack, "he would have let us know who he is.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;56;jack dozed in his chair.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;56;he walked quickly across the room and shook jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;56;frank awoke at the sound of jack's voice and harris also opened his eyes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;56;"well, he's gone again," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;56;"nor i--if he really meant to come back," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;57;"he said lots of things," said jack, "but they didn't make the same impression on me they seem to have made on you.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;57;jack declared.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;57;declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;57;jack and harris had kept up a steady flow of conversation regarding the probable fate that was in store for them if they poked their heads outside the door, and at last jack rose to his feet.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;57;the three made their way upstairs, where they started a thorough search of the house, and at last jack ran onto a closet in which were stored half a dozen suits of civilian clothes.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;57;"now to see if we can find a few guns," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;57;frank gave one of the guns to jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;57;"careful when you open the door, frank," jack warned.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;58;chapter xxv toward freedom jack and harris obeyed frank's injunction and the three flitted back to the parlor silently.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;58;said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;58;"i wish you would tell us who you are, sir," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;58;jack whispered to frank.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;58;jack thereafter maintained a discreet silence.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;"now," he said to jack, frank and harris, "the first thing we must do is to secure the crew and the officers of this vessel.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;"i beg your pardon, sir," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;"in there you will find the first officer," he said he motioned to frank and jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;jack laid his hand on the knob of the door and turned it gently.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;"find the light switch, frank," jack whispered.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;"turn it on when i give the word," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;"all right, but be careful, jack."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;slowly jack tiptoed across the room, where he could dimly see a form stretched across a bunk.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;bending over the figure, jack raised a hand and then called to frank,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;instantly, frank threw the switch and then sprang forward to lend jack a hand should it be necessary.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;jack's fist rose and fell once and the form in the bunk gasped feebly once and lay still.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;"i don't like that sort of thing," said jack, "but i suppose it had to be done.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;then jack and frank left the cabin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;first, however," he said, addressing jack and frank, "don the clothing of these two officers.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;59;jack donned the uniform, for the german was a big man.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;60;jack, frank and harris, on either side of von ludwig, confronted them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;60;under the muzzles of the revolvers levelled in steady hands by von ludwig and harris, jack and frank set to work binding the members of the crew.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;60;then frank and jack went on deck.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;60;von ludwig motioned to jack and frank, who followed him to the bridge.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;60;von ludwig was just about to address jack when he made out another rowboat coming toward the bismarck .

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;61;templeton."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;61;jack gave the word and the vessel dashed ahead.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;61;jack sprang after von ludwig.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;61;under the muzzles of the weapons of jack and von ludwig, the men obeyed, for there seemed nothing else to do.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;62;no questions were asked and the others followed jack and von ludwig from the room, leaving harris in command of the german crew of five.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;62;von ludwig called to jack to follow him and returned to the bridge.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;62;"they'll do better with the next shot, sir," said jack, quietly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;63;the gun crew, who had been on the point of trying to join von ludwig and jack, saw the strategy of this plan and stooped down behind the guns.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;63;the man aft, by a dash, succeeded in reaching the side of von ludwig and jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;63;"signal the engine room to slow down," said von ludwig to jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;63;jack obeyed and the ship came to a pause.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;63;frank sprang to the shelter of the bridge, jack and von ludwig protecting his retreat.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;63;now the four in the shelter of the bridge--von ludwig, frank, jack and the man who had come from the after part of the vessel, stood to their full height and fired into the crowd.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;64;"signal the engine room, jack," instructed von ludwig.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;64;from time to time jack signalled the engine room, thinking perhaps that harris had only been wounded and that he might answer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;64;then jack signalled,"full speed ahead."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;64;before answering jack's signal, after regaining consciousness, he had closed and barred the engine-room door and now he paid no attention to the hammering upon it.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;64;"we'll have to lend harris a hand, sir," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;64;a spurt of flame showed jack where one was hidden.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;64;before the man could fire again, jack had leaped forward and seized him by his revolver arm.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;64;there was but one thing for jack to do.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;65;"all except you, frank, and you, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;65;jack, you stand at the head of the companionway and shoot the first german who appears there."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;65;"very well, sir," said jack, although he was disappointed that he was not permitted to go to harris' aid.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;65;"you are attempting too much, sir," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;65;jack also came up to them.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;65;jack sprang aside as a bullet plowed its way through the hard wood.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;66;"not much," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;66;"and me," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;66;"yes, sir," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;66;he cut the cards and exposed to view a jack of hearts.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;66;jack cut the cards next.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;66;"looks like i was the fellow to stay, all right," said jack, smiling slightly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;66;jack shrugged.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;67;jack was the first to extend a hand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;67;as he shook hands with the others, harris kept his left hand behind him, for in it reposed the card he had palmed--the six of diamonds, which would have allowed him to go with the others and would have put jack in his place.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;67;jack picked up the deck.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;67;as frank and jack shook hands with harris, the latter squeezed harris' hand affectionately.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;67;a moment more jack was in the motor boat and it moved away.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;67;i was afraid jack would cut the low card.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;67;i wouldn't have done it for one of the others, but jack, well, he's a boy after my own heart."

rail;Rallidae;organism;PG10081;70;at the rail he paused for a moment, gathering his strength for a final effort.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;"poor harris," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;jack drew the fateful deck of cards from his pocket.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;jack counted the cards again.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;"you couldn't have played solitaire with this deck," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;again jack ran through the deck there were but fifty-one cards.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;jack arranged them in order.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;jack found what it was a moment later.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;for some moments jack sat silent, staring at the cards before him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;said frank, who had heard jack's muttered words, but had not caught their import.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;"i said," replied jack, slowly, "that harris cheated."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;"that's it," said jack, quietly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;"it's true," declared jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;70;jack explained and for a few moments von ludwig was lost in thought.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;"i wish," said jack, suddenly, to von ludwig, "that you would tell me who you really are.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;"for instance, you, jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;for answer von ludwig rose in his seat and stripped from his face the heavy german beard that had given him the true teutonic expression, and there stood revealed before jack and frank none other than lord hastings, their erstwhile commander and good friend.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;jack, not so given to demonstrations as his chum, also advanced and grasped lord hasting's hand.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;"i wish you would, sir," said jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;frank and jack nodded, for they had known this some time before.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;frank and jack asked no further questions along that line.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;71;jack wanted to know.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;72;asked jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;72;"never, sir," declared jack, positively.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10081;72;a day or two later, frank and jack again found themselves installed in the comfortable home of lord hastings, where they sat down to await what time might bring forth--confident, however, that it would not be long before they were upon active service under the command of their good friend, lord hastings.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;86;as i saw district attorney fox about to enter upon this topic, i gathered myself together to meet the onslaught, for in this matter i could not be strictly truthful, since the least slip on my part might awaken the whole world to the fact that it could only have come there through the agency of carmel herself.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;87;from this imposing presence, nobly sustained by a well-proportioned figure and a head and face indicative of intellect and every kindly attribute, i turned to gaze upon mr. fox and his colleagues.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;91;district attorney fox's lips curled with an imperceptible smile of disdain, which might have impressed the jury if they had been looking his way, but they were all looking with eager and interested eyes at the prisoner, who had just uttered this second distinct and unequivocal denial.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;92;that counsel, strangely alive to the temper and feelings of his audience, waited just long enough for the few simple and solemn words uttered by the accused man to produce their full effect, then with a side glance at mr. fox, whose equanimity he had at last succeeded in disturbing, and whose cross-examination of the prisoner he had still to fear, continued his own examination by demanding why, when the ring was discovered in adelaide's casket and he saw what inferences would be drawn from the fact, he had not made an immediate public explanation of his conduct and the reasons he had had for putting his hand there.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;92;this was a direct blow at myself, and of course called mr. fox to his feet, with a motion to strike out this answer.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;100;but it was not yet the impenetrable gloom presaging conviction, and directing ella's gaze towards mr. moffat, who seemed but little disturbed either by mr. fox's satisfaction or the prisoner's open despair, i took heart of grace and waited for the district attorney's next move.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10083;104;strangulation was a horrible death to contemplate, and if this factor in the crime--she was not deceived by carmel's exclamation that there had been no murder--was unknown as yet to her patient, as it must be from what she had said, and the absolute impossibility, as she thought, of her having known what went on in the whispering pines, then it had better remain unknown to her until circumstances forced it on her knowledge, or she had gotten sufficient strength to bear it.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;110;mr. fox, whose mind without doubt had been engaged in a debate from the first, as to the desirability of challenging the testimony of this young girl, whose faculties had so lately recovered from a condition of great shock and avowed forgetfulness that no word as yet had come to him of her restored health, started to arise at her words, but noting the prisoner's attitude, he hastily reseated himself, realising, perhaps, that evidence of which he had never dreamed lay at the bottom of the client's manner and the counsel's complacency.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;110;mr. fox, glancing at the jury, saw there would be small use in questioning at this time the mental capacity of the witness.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10083;110;i drove back in my brother's cutter and being all alone just as before, i put the horse away myself, and went into my empty home and up to adelaide's room, where i lost consciousness."

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;112;mr. moffat glanced at mr. fox, but that gentleman, passing over this artless expression of feeling, as unworthy an objection, he went steadily on,

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;112;this brought mr. fox to his feet.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;123;her eyes, fixed on the attorney's face, wavered and, had they followed their natural impulse, would have turned towards her brother, but her fear--possibly her love--was her counsellor and she brought them back to mr. fox.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;127;what was mr. fox asking her now?

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;128;mr. fox shifted his inquiries.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10083;129;"then or when you unharnessed your horse, or afterward, as you passed back to the house?"

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;133;his task was not yet over, and the grimness of mr. fox, and the non-committal aspect of the jurymen, proved that it was not to be made too easy for him.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;133;this satisfying mr. moffat, he was passed over to mr. fox, and a short cross-examination ensued on this point.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10083;134;"had not this younger sister even enjoined secrecy upon you in asking you to harness the horse?"

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10083;134;mr. fox gave up the game, and i looked to be the next person called.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10083;135;here mr. moffat recapitulated those events, but always from the standpoint of the defendant--a standpoint which necessarily brought before the jury the many excellent reasons which his client had for supposing this crime to have resulted solely from the conflicting interests represented by that furtively passed note, and the visit of two girls instead of one to the whispering pines.

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10084;31;once he sprang off in pursuit of a rabbit, but he had not taken twenty leaps when he stopped and looked back.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;31;gray wolf had not moved an inch.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;31;ever after this he returned to the point where he had left gray wolf, knowing that he would find her there.

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10084;31;"it was either a lynx or a bear.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;31;another wolf could not do that."

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;31;gray wolf and the gloom of the night were calling him, and he answered that call with a slouch of his shoulders and a drooping head.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;31;the moon had risen when he rejoined gray wolf.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;32;from now on, during the days that followed, it was a last great fight between blind and faithful gray wolf and the woman.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;32;if joan had known of what lay in the thicket, if she could once have seen the poor creature to whom kazan was now all life--the sun, the stars, the moon, and food--she would have helped gray wolf.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;32;kazan had taken gray wolf to a wooded point on the river two days before, and there he had left her the preceding night when he went to the cabin.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10084;32;joan waved her hand back at the cabin, just disappearing behind the trees.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;32;they were drifting past the point now, and the scent of gray wolf came to kazan's nostrils, rousing him, and bringing a low whine from his throat.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;32;it was gray wolf.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;32;at last gray wolf, the faithful, understood.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;32;gray wolf's forefeet were in the water.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;32;gray wolf had won.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;but as man dates events from his birth, his marriage, his freedom from a bondage, or some foundation-step in his career, so all things seemed to kazan to begin with two tragedies which had followed one fast upon the other after the birth of gray wolf's pups.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;the first was the fight on the sun rock, when the big gray lynx had blinded his beautiful wolf mate for all time, and had torn her pups into pieces.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;but gray wolf was still blind.

fang;Carnivora;body;PG10084;33;so at thought of that night he always snarled, and his lips curled back to reveal his inch-long fangs.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;so kazan's life seemed now to be made up chiefly of three things,his hatred of everything that bore the scent or mark of the lynx, his grieving for joan and the baby, and gray wolf.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;it was natural that the strongest passion in him should be his hatred of the lynx, for not only gray wolf's blindness and the death of the pups, but even the loss of the woman and the baby he laid to that fatal struggle on the sun rock.

cat;Felis;organism;PG10084;33;wherever he struck the scent of the big gray cat he was turned into a snarling demon, and his hatred grew day by day, as he became more completely a part of the wild.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;he found that gray wolf was more necessary to him now than she had ever been since the day she had left the wolf-pack for him.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10084;33;he was three-quarters dog, and the dog-part of him demanded companionship.

dog;Canidae;organism;PG10084;33;he was three-quarters dog, and the dog-part of him demanded companionship.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;there was only gray wolf to give him that now.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;often, in the days of the woman and the baby, gray wolf had spent her nights alone out in the forest, waiting and calling for kazan.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;in her blindness gray wolf could no longer hunt with her mate.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;by early summer gray wolf could travel with kazan, if he did not move too swiftly.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;very quickly he found that he must choose the easiest trails for gray wolf's feet.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;when they came to a space to be bridged by a leap, he would muzzle gray wolf and whine, and she would stand with ears alert--listening.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;33;it became a curious habit of kazan's always to look at gray wolf when they stopped to listen, or to scent the air.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10084;33;grass and vines began to grow in the path.

grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10084;33;grass and vines began to grow in the path.

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10084;34;kazan usually hunted the big snow-shoe rabbits.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;34;the kill was too heavy to drag to gray wolf, so he returned to where she was waiting for him and guided her to the feast.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;34;gray wolf caught the scent of it when it was still two days to the west.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;34;all the next day gray wolf was nervous, and toward noon kazan caught in the air the warning that she had sensed many hours ahead of him.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;34;not for an instant did he leave gray wolf.

fisher-cat;Martes pennanti;organism;PG10084;35;a fisher-cat was snarling at the lynx.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;35;gray wolf came to his side and licked his neck, where fresh blood was crimsoning his tawny hide.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;35;at the uttermost end of the sand-bar kazan and gray wolf rolled themselves into balls and thrust their heads under their bodies.

beaver;Castor;organism;PG10084;35;here beavers had built a dam, and they were able to cross over into the green country on the opposite side.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;36;and as kazan and gray wolf came from the west, there came from the hudson's bay post to the east a slim dark-faced french half-breed by the name of henri loti, the most famous lynx hunter in all the hudson's bay country.

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10084;36;it was a game paradise, and the snow-shoe rabbit abounded in thousands.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;36;the facts behind henri's tale of woe struck him as important, and until midnight they talked about the two strange wolves.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;36;"there is one big wolf an' one smaller," said henri.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;36;"an' it is always the big wolf who goes in an' fights the lynx.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;36;while he's fighting, the smaller wolf makes many tracks in the snow just out of reach, an' then when the lynx is down, or dead, it jumps in an' helps tear it into pieces.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;36;not a day passed that somewhere along henri's trap-line they did not see the trails of the two wolves, and weyman observed that--as henri had told him--the footprints were always two by two, and never one by one.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;37;weyman saw where the smaller wolf had waited on its haunches, while its companion had killed the lynx.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;38;if the lynx was caught, and the two wolves came to destroy it, the fight would take place in that shelter under the windfall, and the marauders would have to pass through the opening.

moss;Bryophyta;organism;PG10084;38;so henri set five smaller traps, concealing them skilfully under leaves and moss and snow, and all were far enough away from the bait-house so that the trapped lynx could not spring them in his struggles.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;56;he went to gray wolf and, panting still harder, she licked his face.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10084;56;kazan had heard that sound before, and like all other beasts had learned to ignore the presence of the innocuous creature that made it.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;56;then he flattened himself on his belly, stretched out his forelegs, closed his eyes, and without any other sound except an occasional yelp of pain allowed gray wolf to go on with the operation.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;56;for an hour gray wolf kept faithfully at her task and by the end of that time had succeeded in pulling out most of the quills.

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10084;57;he stood in the opening, a rabbit between his jaws.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;57;he took no offense at the snarl, but stood for a moment, gazing into the gloom where gray wolf had hidden herself.

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG10084;57;then he dropped the rabbit and lay down squarely in the opening.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;57;there was a responsive whine in his throat, and in the darkness came the quick soft caress of gray wolf's tongue.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;57;as if it were but yesterday they remembered the moonlit night when the lynx brought blindness to gray wolf and destroyed her young, and when kazan had avenged himself and his mate in his terrible fight to the death with their enemy.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;57;and now, with that soft little handful of life snuggling close up against her, gray wolf saw through her blind eyes the tragic picture of that night more vividly than ever and she quivered at every sound, ready to leap in the face of an unseen foe, to rend all flesh that was not the flesh of kazan.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10084;58;finally came the time when he reached the opening and crouched there, blinking and frightened at what he saw, and now gray wolf no longer tried to hold him back but went out into the sunshine and tried to call him to her.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10093;1;when he had been at school for about three weeks, the boys called him six-fingered jack, but his real name was willie, for his father and mother gave it him--not william, but willie, after a brother of his father, who died young, and had always been called willie.

flax;Linum usitatissimum;organism;PG10093;3;down the street of the village, which was very straggling, with nearly as many little gardens as houses in it, there was a house occupied by several poor people, in one end of which, consisting just of a room and a closet, an old woman lived who got her money by spinning flax into yarn for making linen.

mahogany;Swietenia;organism;PG10093;3;for mrs wilson had had a better house to live in once, and this chair, as well as the chest of drawers of dark mahogany, with brass handles, that stood opposite the window, was part of the furniture she saved when she had to sell the rest, and well it was, she used to say, for her old rheumatic bones that she had saved the chair at least.

willet;Tringa semipalmata;organism;PG10093;7;"mr willet," he said, for he knew every man of any standing in the village by name and profession, "why did you put bits of coal into the hole you were making?

corn;Zea mays;organism;PG10093;22;he saw the corn go in by the hopper into the trough which was the real hopper, for it kept constantly hopping to shake the corn down through a hole in the middle of the upper stone, which went round and round against the lower, so that between them they ground the corn to meal, which, in the story beneath, he saw pouring, a solid stream like an avalanche, from a wooden spout.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10093;28;one evening, when he had set the little brook free to run through the garden, and the sun was setting huge and red, with the promise of another glowing day to-morrow, and the air was stifling, and not a breath of wind stirring, so that the flowers hung their heads oppressed, and the leaves and little buttons of fruit on the trees looked ready to shrivel up and drop from the boughs, the thought came to him whether he could not turn the brook into a little nile, causing it to overflow its banks and enrich the garden.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10093;38;all the things from his former nest had been moved into it, the bed with the chintz curtains, covered with strange flowers and birds, the old bureau, with the many drawers inside the folding cover, in which he kept all his little treasures, the table at which he read books that were too big to hold, such as raleigh's history of the world and josephus, the old oblong mirror that hung on the wall, with an outspread gilt eagle at the top of it, the big old arm-chair that had belonged to his great-grandfather, who wrote his sermons in it--for all the things the boy had about him were old, and in all his after-life he never could bear new furniture.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10094;61;it was pointed out that we had less than half the horses we really needed, and those we had were so weak from the diet of leaves to which they had been reduced that they could do little work.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10094;61;so the general urged that all unnecessary baggage be sent back to the fort, and that as many horses as possible be given to the public cause.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10094;61;he and his staff set the example by contributing twenty horses, and this had so great effect among the officers that near a hundred were added to the train.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10094;61;a deprivation which, i doubt not, cost some of the officers more than any other, was that of their women, who were ordered back to the fort, and only two women for each company were allowed to be victualed upon the march, but in this particular the example set by the general was not so commendable as in the matter of the horses.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10095;53;opening them immediately afterwards, he saw with relief that the phantoms had vanished, and that he confronted what at least seemed a fellow-mortal, in the ancient ratcatcher, habited precisely as cardinal barbadico had described, yet, for all his mean apparel, wearing the air of one wont to confer with the potentates of the earth on other subjects than the extermination of rats.

alexander;Smyrnium olusatrum;organism;PG10095;53;"i tell you what, my man," responded alexander, feeling it very necessary to assert his dignity while any of it remained, "you are not to imagine that, because i have humoured you so far as to grant you an audience at an unusual place and time, i am going to stand any amount of your nonsense and impertinence.

alexander;Smyrnium olusatrum;organism;PG10095;53;"alexander," said the ratcatcher composedly, "i would not commend or dispraise you unduly, but this i may say, that of all the popes i have known you are the most exuberant in hypocrisy and the most deficient in penetration.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10095;56;his illusion was at first explained as the effect of a peculiarly vivid dream, but when he declared his intention of actually holding a service and conducting a procession for the weal of his namesake and predecessor, the conviction became universal that the rats had effected a lodgement in his holiness's upper storeys.

alexander;Smyrnium olusatrum;organism;PG10095;56;alexander, notwithstanding, was resolute, and so it came to pass that on the same day two mighty processions encountered within the walls of rome.

alexander;Smyrnium olusatrum;organism;PG10095;56;as the assembled clergy, drawn from all the churches and monasteries in the city, the pope in his litter in their midst, marched, carrying candles, intoning chants, and, with many a secret shrug and sneer, imploring heaven for the repose of alexander the sixth, they were suddenly brought to bay by another procession precipitated athwart their track, disorderly, repulsive, but more grateful to the sight of the citizens than all the pomps and pageants of the palmiest days of the papacy.

alexander;Smyrnium olusatrum;organism;PG10095;56;glances of recognition were exchanged, and instantly in place of the ratcatcher stood a tall, swarthy, corpulent, elderly man, with the majestic yet sensual features of alexander the sixth, accoutred with the official habiliments and insignia of a pope, who rose slowly into the air as though he had been inflated with hydrogen.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;77;pan's wand iridion had broken her lily.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;77;from her birth the fate of iridion had been associated with that of a flower of unusual loveliness--a stately, candid lily, endowed with a charmed life, like its possessor.

plant;Plantae;organism;PG10095;77;not one had fallen as yet, and iridion felt no pain or any symptom of approaching dissolution, except, it may be, the unwonted seriousness with which, having exhausted all her simple skill on behalf of the languishing plant, she sat down to consider its fate in the light of its bearing upon her own.

goat;Capra hircus;organism;PG10095;77;the honest god was on excellent terms with the simple people, his goats browsed freely along with theirs, and the most melodious of the rustic minstrels attributed their proficiency to his instructions.

goat;Capra hircus;organism;PG10095;78;the sylvan deity stood, in fact, at the entrance of his cavern, about to proceed in quest of his goats.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;78;"pan," she began, "i have broken my lily."

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;78;pan therefore never doubted iridion's strange narrative, and, having heard it to the end, observed, "you will find plenty more lilies in elysium."

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;78;"common lilies, pan, not like mine."

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;78;the lilies of elysium--asphodels as they call them there--are as immortal as the elysians themselves.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;78;as the maiden spake a petal detached itself from the emaciated lily, and she pressed her hand to her brow with a responsive cry of pain.

fern;Polypodiopsida;organism;PG10095;78;saying this, pan, with rough tenderness, deposited the almost fainting maiden upon a couch of fern, and, having supported her head with a bundle of herbs, leaned his own upon his hand, and reflected with all his might.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10095;78;the declining sun was now nearly opposite the cavern's mouth, and his rays, straggling through the creepers that wove their intricacies over the entrance, chequered with lustrous patches the forms of the dying girl and the meditating god.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;79;on the ferny couch stood an earthen vase, from which rose a magnificent lily, stately, with unfractured stem, and with no stain or wrinkle on its numerous petals.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;79;the stranger, without disturbing his veil, seemed to comprehend the whole interior of the grotto with a glance, then, with the slightest gesture of recognition to pan, he glided to the couch on which lay the metamorphosed lily, upraised the fictitious iridion in his arms with indescribable gentleness, and disappeared with her as swiftly and silently as he had come.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;79;there was a glory and a splendour in the flower such as had never until then been beheld in any earthly lily.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;79;the unbidden guest uttered no word, but his manner was sufficiently expressive of wrath as he disdainfully cast on the ground a broken, withered lily, the relic of what had bloomed with such loveliness in the morning, and had since for a brief space been arrayed in the vesture of humanity.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10095;80;pan, looking eagerly after the psyche in its flight, did not perceive what was taking place in the cavern, but the magic wand, now for ever lost to its possessor, must have cancelled its own spell, for when his gaze reverted from the ineffectual pursuit, the living lily had disappeared, and iridion lay a corpse upon the ground, the faded flower of her destiny reposing upon her breast.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10095;90;our philosopher, therefore, did not occupy himself with considering whether in that miniature world, with its countless varieties of animal and vegetable being, something might not be found with which he was himself unacquainted, but, like the honey-freighted bee, rather sought an opportunity of disburdening himself of his stores of information than of adding to them.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10095;90;the noisy birds could not hear themselves speak, much less him, he shrewdly distrusted his ability to command the attention of the busy bees, and even a member of the universal knowledge society may well be at a loss for a suitable address to an earwig.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;51;yet as a man with some leisure, and knowing by that letter of elma heath's that she was in sore distress, i redoubled my efforts to ascertain the reason of it all.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;51;hitherto i had remained passive rather than active, but i now realized by that curious letter that at least one woman's life was at stake--that elma heath was in possession of some secret.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;51;on my journey back to london, as the train swung through peterborough and out across the rich level lands towards hitchin, i recollected jack durnford's words when i had mentioned the lola .

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;57;if elma heath were really dead, then she was beyond discovery, and the truth would be hidden forever.

bully;Sideroxylon;organism;PG10102;60;sight of it had changed the chief of police from a burly bully into a whining coward, for he saw that he had torn up the passport of a guest of the czar, and the consequence was most serious if i complained.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;60;"i desire to know the whereabouts of a young english lady named elma heath," i said, and i wrote down the name for him upon a piece of paper.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;62;for that reason i had sought news of the young english lady--the mademoiselle heath."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10102;62;i think i must have waited half an hour, when my attention was suddenly attracted by the rattle of wheels over the stones, and turning i saw an old closed carriage drawn by three horses abreast, with bells upon the harness, approaching me rapidly.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10102;62;and then the instant i was seated, and before i could close the door, the horses plunged forward and we were tearing at full gallop out of the town.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10102;62;all around was a houseless land, rolling miles of brown and green, broken and checkered by bits of forest and clumps of dark melancholy pines.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;63;elma heath was in hiding.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10102;63;two hours later we pulled up before a long log-built post-house just beyond a small town in a hollow that faced the sea, and i alighted to watch the steaming horses being replaced by a trio of fresh ones.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10102;63;then, resuming our journey, the short day quickly drew to a close, the sun sank yellow and watery over the towering pines through which we went mile after mile, a dense, interminable forest wherein the wolves lurked in winter, often rendering the road dangerous.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10102;63;when night drew on we changed horses again at a small, dirty post-house in the forest, at the edge of a lake, and then pushed forward again, although it was already long past the hour at which he had said we should arrive.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10102;63;time passed slowly in the darkness, for we had no light, and the horses seemed to find their way by instinct.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10102;63;in the starlight i could distinguish that it stretched gray and level to a distance, and that the opposite bank was fringed with pines.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10102;64;the river suddenly narrowed again, with high pines on either bank, a silent, lonesome reach, perhaps indeed one of the loneliest spots in all europe.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10102;64;once the dismal howl of a wolf sounded close to where we passed, but my guide made no remark.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;64;"i wish to see miss elma heath."

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;65;"and he is uncle of this young lady, elma heath?"

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;71;there was the sound of the crashing of wood as the rotten platform gave way, a loud splash, and next instant the dark waters closed over the big, bearded fellow who would have snatched elma heath from me, and have held me prisoner in that castle of terrors.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10102;72;but the finlander had apparently foreseen this, and for that reason we were lying safe from observation in the deep shadow of an overhanging tree.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10102;73;so dark that we could see before us hardly a foot, we were compelled to place our hands in front of us to avoid collision with the big tree trunks, while ever and anon we found ourselves entangled in the mass of dead creepers and vegetable parasites that formed the dense undergrowth.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10102;73;once we saw afar through the trees the light of a lantern held by a guard, and already the sweet-faced girl beside me seemed tired and terribly fatigued.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10102;74;this wood, we found, was of tall high pines, where walking was not difficult, a wide wilderness of trees which, hour after hour, we traversed in the vain endeavor to find the rough path which our guide told us led for a hundred miles from alavo down to tammerfors, the manufacturing center of the country.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10102;74;but of food we had nothing, save a small piece of hard rye bread which the finn had in his pocket, the remains of his evening meal, and this we gave to elma, who, half famished, ate it quickly.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10102;74;we knew quite well that it would be an easy matter to die of starvation in that great trackless forest, therefore we kept on undaunted, while the yellow autumn sun struggled through the dark pines, glinting on the straight gray trunks and reflecting a golden light in that dead unbroken silence.

ray;Rajomorphii;organism;PG10102;74;while there was still a ray of light i watched her white refined features as she slept, and was sorely tempted to bend and imprint a kiss upon that soft inviting cheek.

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10102;74;the long cold night passed wearily, and the howling of the wolves caused me to grip my revolver, yet at daybreak we arose refreshed, and notwithstanding the terrible pangs of hunger now gnawing at our vitals, we were prepared to renew our desperate dash for liberty.

brick;Thunbergia mysorensis;organism;PG10102;75;the place was a poor one of two low rooms, built of rough log-pines, with double windows for the winter and a high brick stove.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10102;76;two big, hulking fellows in heavy riding-coats and swords strode in, while two others remained mounted outside, holding the horses.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;96;what connection could jack durnford, of the marines, have with the adventurer philip leithcourt?

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;96;i, however, recollected jack's word, when i had described the visit of the lola to leghorn, and further i recollected that very shortly he would be back in london from his term of mediterranean service.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;98;it was a cold but dry november night in london, and i sat dining with jack durnford at a small table in the big, well-lit room of the junior united service club.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;99;"i first met them yachting over at algiers," jack said.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10102;99;he called himself martin woodroffe up there--although i'd known him at the old corinthian club as dick archer.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;99;"perhaps our leithcourts are not the same as those jack knows," i remarked, in order to escape from a rather difficult situation, whereupon durnford, as though eager to conceal his surprise, said with a forced laugh, "oh!

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;99;i could not help noticing that jack durnford was upset at what he had learnt, yet i hesitated just then to put any question to him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;100;"you've been a bit down in the mouth to-night, jack," i said presently, after we had been watching the cabs coming up, depositing the home-coming revelers from the savoy or the carlton.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10102;100;"and martin woodroffe is engaged to muriel leithcourt.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;100;for some time jack durnford smoked in silence, and i could just distinguish his white, hard face in the faint light, for it was now late, and the big electric lamps had been turned out and we were in semi-darkness.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;100;have you met elma heath?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;100;"there is a greater mystery surrounding that yacht, the lola , than you have ever imagined, my dear old chap," declared jack durnford, looking me straight in the face.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;101;he's not a fellow who sticks at trifles," said jack warningly.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;102;"well, he might do so, in order to save himself, you see," jack replied, adding,"he certainly would have no compunction if he thought that it would not be brought home to him.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;102;"it does--a ghastly truth concerning elma heath," he answered in a low voice, as though speaking to himself.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;102;i'm dying, jack, to know everything concerning her.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;103;as the light of the street lamp fell upon them, i thought i recognized the face of one as that of a person i had seen before, yet i was not at all certain, and my failure to remember whom the passer-by resembled prevented me from saying anything further to jack than,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;104;in an instant i recollected what jack had told me, and regarded him with some suspicion.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;107;jack had not been to the club, and i began now to grow thoroughly uneasy.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;107;i waited for no more, but rushed round to the hospital in the cab, and was, five minutes later, taken along the ward, where i identified poor jack lying in bed, white-faced and unconscious.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;107;jack had not regained consciousness, and the doctor regarded his case as hopeless.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;107;you, mr. gregg, have been in peril of your life, that i know, but jack's enemies are yours, and they shall not go unpunished.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;108;we were not allowed to linger there, and on leaving the hospital i took her back again to notting hill, promising to keep her well informed of jack's condition.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;108;"i always believed that you were engaged to mr. woodroffe," i said one day, when i called to tell her of jack's latest bulletin.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;108;i must see jack.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;108;one afternoon, ten days after the attempt upon jack, i was allowed to sit by his bedside and question him.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;108;all i know is that an hour later when i returned i found them the happiest pair possible to conceive, and i clearly saw that jack's trust in her was not ill-placed.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;109;jack, when at last discharged from the hospital, came across to the cecil and lived with me in preference to the "junior."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;109;she knew that i loved elma and was also aware of the exciting events in russia, jack having told her of them during their long drives in hansoms when he went out with her to take the air.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;109;jack, now thoroughly recovered, called almost daily at bassett road, and would often bring muriel to the cecil to tea or to luncheon.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;109;she seemed quick and nervous and yet full of happiness, as she should indeed have been, for jack durnford was one of the best fellows in the world, and his restoration to health little short of miraculous.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;109;but it was not until the third occasion, when the yacht was at villefranche, and our squadron being at toulon i got four days' leave to go along the riviera, that my suspicions were aroused, for at the very hour when i was dining at the london house at nice with muriel and a schoolfellow of hers, elma heath--who was spending the winter there with a lady who was baron oberg's cousin--that a great robbery was committed in one of the big hotels up at cimiez, the wife of an american millionaire losing jewels valued at thirty thousand pounds.

heath;Erica (Ericaceae);organism;PG10102;110;from elma heath's conversation at dinner that evening at nice i gathered that she and her uncle had been guests on the iris on several occasions, although i must say that muriel was extremely reticent regarding all that concerned the yacht."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;110;"now that i have told you the truth, jack, don't you think it was only natural?"

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;111;"there was a tragedy," jack explained in a low, hoarse voice.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;113;muriel was already helping my love out of her heavy russian coat, a costly garment lined with sable, and when, after greeting jack and olinto, she was comfortably seated, i took some notepaper from the little writing-table by the window and scribbled in pencil the words,

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10102;114;presently, when by signs both jack and olinto had urged her to write, she bent suddenly, and her pencil began to run swiftly over the paper.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;7;"how did you know that miss martin was here?"

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;8;grant had received several shocks since rising from the breakfast-table, but it was left for doris martin, the postmaster's daughter, to administer not the least surprising one.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;9;on her part, doris martin was now in full control of her emotions, and she undoubtedly took a saner view of a difficult situation.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;10;i--happened to notice her as she passed in the hare and hounds 'bus.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;10;"miss melhuish hadn't been in the village five minutes," he said, "before she asked mr. tomlin, landlord of the hare and hounds, where the hollies was, and how long mr. grant had lived in the village.

flicker;Colaptes;organism;PG10110;10;superintendent fowler allowed his placid features to show a flicker of surprise.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;10;in front of the hare and hounds had gathered a group of men, and it was easy to guess the topic they were discussing.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10110;11;not so p. c. robinson, who tried to look like a judge, whereas he really resembled a bull-terrier who has literally, not figuratively, smelt a rat.

ash;Fraxinus;organism;PG10110;12;it was not until the fire of sacrifice had died into parched ashes that its earlier banality became clear.

viper;Viperidae;organism;PG10110;13;now he surveyed him as if he were a viper.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;13;last evening, as the outcome of a chat on the subject, doris martin, daughter of the local postmaster, came here to view sirius through an astronomical telescope.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;13;"miss martin came here about a quarter to ten," continued grant, "and left within three-quarters of an hour.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;13;"well, that is the be-all and end-all of miss martin's presence.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;16;he hurried to the post office, hoping that doris martin might walk back with him.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;16;she was about to attend to him, but mr. martin intervened.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;16;mr. martin read it gravely, stated the cost, and procured the requisite stamps.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;16;tomlin, landlord of the hare and hounds inn, surveyed him from the "snug."

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;16;he went home, gave an emphatic order that no one, except miss martin, if she called, was to be admitted and savagely buried himself in a treatise on earth-tides.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;16;he had, perforce, eaten a good meal, and was thinking of going to the post office in order to clear up an undoubted misapprehension in mr. martin's mind, when minnie bates came with a card.

salmon;Oncorhynchus;organism;PG10110;18;ingerman was playing him as a fisherman humors a well-hooked salmon.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;20;probably his rest, such as it was, would have been even more disturbed had he been able to accompany ingerman to the hare and hounds inn.

sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG10110;21;he knew instantly that if he could persuade this one "probable juror" of grant's guilt, the remainder would follow his lead like a flock of sheep.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;21;we all know that doris martin an' mr. grant were a'sweet-'eartin' in the garden--"

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;21;"look here, hobbs, just keep doris martin's name out of it!"

partridge;Perdix perdix;organism;PG10110;21;siddle stirred uneasily, but the others were still as partridges in stubble.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10110;21;ingerman did not intend to alarm the shy bird of the covey, however.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;22;then ingerman made a very shrewd guess, and wondered who doris martin was, and what hobbs's cryptic allusion had meant.

birds;Aves;organism;PG10110;22;there's an old adage, 'birds of a feather flock together.'

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;22;before the inn was cleared, what between elkin's savage comments and the other men's thinly-veiled allusions, he knew all that steynholme could tell with regard to grant and doris martin.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;22;in effect, had doris martin attended the best of boarding-schools and training colleges, she would have received a smattering of french and a fair knowledge of the piano or violin, whereas, after more humble tuition, it might fairly be said of her that few girls of her age had read so many books and assimilated their contents so thoroughly.

martins;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;23;already there was a cloud between him and the martins, father and daughter.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;23;the press could say nothing as yet of marital disagreements, nor was any hint concerning doris martin allowed to appear.

hazel;Corylus;organism;PG10110;23;turning into a winding bridle-path tucked between hedges of thorn and hazels, he walked to a point where it crossed a patch of furze.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10110;24;moreover, peeping through the first screen of trees that offered, he had the mortification of seeing the man who had befooled him go back the way he came.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10110;24;"well, you'll hardly find him on bush walk," which was the name of the path.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;24;pity you weren't in the hare and hounds last night.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;24;"three o'clock, in the club-room of the hare and hounds."

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;24;what about doris martin?

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;25;bet you a fiver i'm engaged to doris martin within a week."

hop;Humulus lupulus;organism;PG10110;25;"i'll catch her on the hop, of course.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;25;mr. martin, sorting some documents, came forward when he saw grant.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;25;"good morning, mr. martin," said grant.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;25;martin, usually the mildest-mannered man in sussex, was obviously ill at ease.

mignonette;Reseda;organism;PG10110;25;a window-box of mignonette filled the air with its delicate perfume.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;25;"now, mr. martin," he said gravely, "you and i should have a serious talk.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;25;mr. martin reddened.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;26;but martin had either made up his mind or been warned not to discuss the murder, and adhered loyally to that line of conduct.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;27;"you have evidently been told that miss martin and i were star-gazing in the garden of my house," he said.

canis;Canis;organism;PG10110;27;there was a very fine cluster of small stars in canis major, south of sirius, that night."

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;27;let me assure you now, in miss martin's presence, that she is no more concerned in this ghastly business than any other young lady in the village."

holly;Ilex;organism;PG10110;27;doris gasped when she heard superintendent fowler's version of the view a coroner's jury might take of her presence in the garden of the hollies at a late hour.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;28;"it's a regular romance--quite in your line, mr. grant, of course, but none the less enthralling because, as you so happily phrased miss martin's lesson in astronomy, it happens to be true."

holly;Ilex;organism;PG10110;28;i may have been there about ten minutes, no longer, when i saw the study window of the hollies thrown open, and mr. grant's figure was silhouetted by the lamp behind him.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10110;28;when the trees are in leaf, all the lower part is hidden."

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;28;"you have an unshakable witness in miss martin," said furneaux, stabbing a finger at grant.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;28;mr. martin looked up from his desk when they appeared, and requested his daughter to check a bundle of postal orders.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;29;martin murmured the cost, and grant stormed out again.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;29;this time, passing the hare and hounds, he looked at door and windows.

celery;Apium;organism;PG10110;29;he sought the industrious bates, who was trenching celery in the kitchen garden.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;30;"has miss martin any other suitors?"

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;30;he found a crowd gathered in front of the hare and hounds.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;31;to grant's relief, doris martin was not in attendance.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10110;32;"i took down his statement, sir," said the witness, well knowing that he had wiped off grant's morning score in the matter of bush walk.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;32;"took it to the stable of the hare and hounds, sir."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10110;33;a big, cheerful-looking fellow--from his appearance might be a gentleman-farmer and j. p., with a taste for horses and greyhounds.

apple;Malus domestica;organism;PG10110;33;they'll get him, as sure as god made little apples."

chestnut;Castanea;organism;PG10110;34;i remember a case in which a chestnut in a man's pocket sent him to penal servitude.

chestnut;Castanea;organism;PG10110;34;there was absolutely no evidence against him, except a possible motive, until that chestnut was found and proved to be one of a particular species, grown only in a certain locality."

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;34;what grant really hungered for was a heart-to-heart talk between doris martin and himself.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10110;34;a huge meerschaum pipe and tobacco pouch lay on the grass.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10110;34;he had been sentenced to death five times, and decorated by successful jack cades twice as often.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10110;34;"i know all about you, jack," said hart slowly, picking up the pipe and filling it from the pouch.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10110;35;"you're a poor guesser, jack.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10110;36;i suggest that any man who mentions the steynholme murder again before the coffee arrives shall be fined a sovereign for each offense, such fine, or fines, to form a fund for the relief of his hearers.

woodbine;Lonicera periclymenum;organism;PG10110;36;for instance, a clever forger would never descend to thick twist, while a swell mobsman would turn with horror from a woodbine."

walrus;Odobenus rosmarus;organism;PG10110;36;furneaux evidently held the opinion once expressed by a notable walrus--that the time had come to talk of many things,of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax-- of cabbages--and kings.

coffee;Coffea arabica;organism;PG10110;37;no sooner had minnie cleared the table, and brought in the coffee, than he whisked around on grant as though hitherto he had been only awaiting an opportunity of scarifying him.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;37;but what lunatic, barring yourself and the horse-coper, elkin, is in love with doris martin?"

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;37;why harp on doris martin rather than any member of the bates family?"

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;37;"who, may i ask, is doris martin?"

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;37;i tell you unhesitatingly that if doris martin didn't exist, adelaide melhuish would be alive now.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;37;i go farther, and hazard the guess, not the fixed belief, though my guesses are usually borne out by events, that if doris martin had not been in this garden at half past ten on monday night, adelaide melhuish would not have been killed some twenty minutes later.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;37;you heard from miss martin's own lips absolutely the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;38;so far as i can foresee, miss martin's name may be spared any undue prominence in this inquiry.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;38;"i want you to believe me when i tell you," he said, "that i never gave serious thought to the notion of marrying miss martin until such a possibility was suggested last night by that swab, ingerman."

wildcat;Felis silvestris;organism;PG10110;39;shrilled furneaux, nevertheless active as a wildcat in his spring to the french window, there to snatch at the blind and turn the knob which controlled a lever bolt.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10110;40;meanwhile, furneaux, seeing that no dead body was stretched on the strip of grass beneath the window, dashed into the shrubbery to the right, and was clutched in a mighty embrace by an older but much more powerful man in bates, who had hurried from the front of the house on hearing the pistol-shot.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;40;though the night was rather dark for june, he had no difficulty in recognizing doris martin's graceful movements.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;42;but it was doris martin, and very pretty she looked as she entered the room, her high color being the joint outcome of a rapid walk and a very natural embarrassment at finding the frankly admiring eyes of a stranger fixed on her.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;43;but let me remark, miss martin, that i experienced great difficulty, not so long ago, in persuading friend grant that you were the only important witness this case has provided thus far.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10110;43;"my dim recollection of your port, jack, is that it was a wine of many virtues and few vices," he mused aloud.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10110;44;have him in to dinner every day, jack.

holly;Ilex;organism;PG10110;44;it was his presence at the hollies which brought an infatuated woman there, and thus directly led to her death.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;53;"i left the hare and hounds at ten, and came straight home."

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10110;54;he was well aware that the licensing hours were not strictly observed by the hare and hounds when "commercial gentlemen" were in residence.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10110;55;"pedigree horses you mentioned, sir," he said, his rancor against grant being momentarily conquered by the pertinent allusion to his own business.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;59;martin already regretted his aloofness on the day of the inquest, though, truth to tell, hart's expert knowledge of bee-culture was the determining factor.

martins;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;59;when the martins turned with the rest to cross the bridge, grant began to suspect his friend.

martins;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;59;he entered boldly, reached the garden, and hurried to the angle on the edge of the cliff next to the martins' strip of ground.

martin;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10110;59;doris, mr. martin, and peters soon strolled out on to the lawn.

sprite;Arielulus;organism;PG10119;37;to substitute the word 'sprite' for 'spirit,' in an elevated passage referring to milton, appears to me one of the least tolerable instances of make-rhyme in the whole range of english poetry.

sprite;Arielulus;organism;PG10119;37;'sprite' is a trivial and distorted misformation of 'spirit', and can only, i apprehend, be used with some propriety,at any rate, in modern poetry,in a more or less bantering sense.

dead leaf;Kallima inachus;organism;PG10119;42;it may be worth observing that shelley says--'as if she autumn were, or they dead leaves',not ' and they dead leaves',.

dead leaf;Kallima inachus;organism;PG10119;42;he therefore seems to present the act of spring from two separate points of view,,1,she threw down the buds, as if she had been autumn, whose office it is to throw down, and not to cherish and develope,,2,she threw down the buds as if they had been, not buds of the nascent year, but such dead leaves of the olden year as still linger on the spray when spring arrives, 1.

hyacinth;Hyacinthus;organism;PG10119;43;the passage of shelley is rather complicated in its significance, because it mixes up the personages hyacinthus and narcissus with the flowers hyacinth and narcissus.

hyacinth;Hyacinthus;organism;PG10119;43;the beautiful youth hyacinthus was dear to phoebus, on his untimely death,he was slain by a quoit which phoebus threw, and which the jealous zephyrus blew aside so that it struck hyacinthus on the head,, the god changed his blood into the flower hyacinth, which bears markings interpreted by the grecian fancy into the lettering,greek,ai ai,,alas, alas!

hyacinth;Hyacinthus;organism;PG10119;43;this accounts for the lines, 'to phoebus was not hyacinth so dear, nor to himself narcissus.'

hyacinth;Hyacinthus;organism;PG10119;43;we have to do, no longer with the youths hyacinthus and narcissus, but with the flowers hyacinth and narcissus,it is the flowers which,according to shelley,loved adonais better than the youths were loved, the one by phoebus and the other by himself.

hyacinth;Hyacinthus;organism;PG10119;43;as to the hyacinth, the reader will readily perceive that a flower which bears markings read off into,greek,ai ai,,or,greek,ai ai,seems more correct,cannot be the same which we now call hyacinth.

nightingale;Luscinia;organism;PG10119;44;it is possible however--and one willingly supposes so--that shelley singled out the nightingale for mention, in recognition of the consummate beauty of keats's ode to the nightingale , published in the same volume with hyperion .

nightingale;Luscinia;organism;PG10119;44;the epithet 'lorn' may also be noted in the same connexion, as keats's ode terminates with a celebrated passage in which 'forlorn' is the leading word,but not as an epithet for the nightingale itself,-- 'forlorn!

pansy;Junonia;organism;PG10119;51;the pansy is the flower of thought, or memory,we commonly call it heartsease, but shelley no doubt uses it here with a different, or indeed contrary, meaning.

pansies;Junonia;organism;PG10119;51;a stanza from one of his lyrics may be appropriately cited-- remembrance , dated 1821,-- 'lilies for a bridal bed, roses for a matron's head, violets for a maiden dead, pansies let my flowers be.

comma;Polygonia c-album;organism;PG10119;51;it appears to me however that the sense would rather require either a full stop after 'his own,' and a comma after 'sorrow,' or else a comma after 'his own,' and a full stop or colon after 'sorrow.'

mourner;Rhytipterna;organism;PG10119;57;i think shelley means that the successive hopes kindled in the mourner by the ideas of a boundless universe of space and of spirit will have lured him to the very brink of mundane life--to the borderland between life and death,he will almost have been tempted to have done with life, and to explore the possibilities of death.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;41;this great headland, in shape something like a clenched fist, stands between the two branches of the rother, the river which flows into the sea at rye, and which was once navigable by ships so far up as small hythe just under the southern escarpment of the headland upon which tenterden stands.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;41;rye, which had early been added to the cinque ports, was a place of very considerable importance, but upon the east it was entirely cut off by romney marsh, upon the west, too, a considerable marshland closed by a great and desolate hill country closed it in, but to the north was a navigable river, a road that is, leading up into england, and at the head of it a town naturally sprang up.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;41;that town was tenterden, and her true position was recognised by henry vi., when he united her to rye.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;42;domesday book knows nothing of her, as a place of importance, as a town that is, she is a creation of rye, and her development was thus necessarily late and endured but for a season.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;42;i suppose the great days of rye to have been those of the thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and it was therefore during this period that tenterden began its career as a town.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;42;after the failure of the sea, rye sank slowly back into what it is to-day, but tenterden would appear to have stood up against that misfortune with some success, for we find elizabeth incorporating it under a charter.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;43;it is the campagna in little, the great and noble mountains, the loveliest in the world are sunk to hills pure and exquisite upon which, too, we may still see the cities, here little towns and villages, as rye, winchelsea, appledore, lympne or hythe, dear places of england of my heart, and all between them this mysterious and lowly thing not quite of this world, a graveyard one might think, as the campagna is, a battlefield as is the trasimeno plain, a gate and certainly an exit not only out of england but from the world and life itself.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;44;it fell when, as we are told, in a great storm the course of the rother was changed so that it went thereafter to serve rye, and new romney fell slowly down so that to-day but one of those five churches remains, that of st nicholas.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;45;it is true that siena looks out beyond her own gardens and vineyards upon a desert, but it is a very different desolation upon which rye gazes all day long, out of which she rises with all the confidence, grace, and gaiety of a flower, and over which she rules like a queen.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;45;from the ypres tower of rye or the gun garden below it, you look only across the level and empty marsh which sinks beyond camber castle imperceptibly into the greyness and barrenness of the sea.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;45;indeed, to liken rye to any other place is to do her wrong, for both in herself and in that landscape over which she broods, there is enough beauty and enough character to give her a life and a meaning altogether her own.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;45;yet how much has rye lost!

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10120;45;the walls of coeur de lion have fallen, and only one of the gates remains, but so long as the church and the beautiful strong tower of william de ypres stand, and the narrow cobbled streets full of old and humble houses climb up and down the steep hill, the whole place is involved in their beauty and sanctity, our hearts are satisfied and our eyes engaged on behalf of a place at once so old and picturesque and yet so neat and tidy and always ready to receive a guest.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;45;a place like rye, naturally so strong, a steep island surrounded by sea or impassable marsh, must have been a stronghold from very early times, it is in fact obviously old when we first hear of it as a gift, with winchelsea, of edward the confessor's to the benedictine abbey of fecamp just across the grey channel in normandy.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;45;both rye and winchelsea remained within the keeping of the abbey of fecamp until, for reasons of state easy to be understood, henry iii.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;46;for before the end of the twelfth century it would seem rye with winchelsea had become of so much importance as a port as to have been added to the famous cinque ports, sandwich, dover, hythe, romney and hastings.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10120;46;even in 1194 coeur de lion permitted the town to wall itself.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;46;nevertheless louis the dauphin of france took rye, and it may well have been this which determined henry iii.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;46;doubtless rye's greatest moment was this thirteenth century, nor did she appear much less in the fourteenth and the first half of the fifteenth century.

friars;Atherina;organism;PG10120;46;but often sacked and burned, the town was practically destroyed by the french in 1378 and 1448, when only the ypres tower, part of the church, the landgate, the strandgate and the so-called chapel of the carmelite friars escaped destruction.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;46;but from this blow rye recovered to play a part, if a small one, in the defeat of the armada, and though the retreat of the sea, which seems to have begun in the sixteenth century, undoubtedly damaged her, it did not kill her outright as it did winchelsea, for she had the rother to help her, and we find her prosperous not only in the time of the commonwealth, but even to-day, when, with the help of a new harbour at the mouth of the river, she is still able to carry on her trade.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;46;it is of course to this great sanctuary dedicated in honour of the blessed virgin, that everyone will go first in rye.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;47;most of those who come to rye enter the town, and with a sudden surprise not to be found elsewhere, by the landgate upon the north.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;47;it is the landgate which gives to rye its power of surprise, so that a man coming up from the railway, at sight of it, is suddenly transported into the middle age, and in that dream enters and enjoys rye town, which has never disappointed those who have come in the right spirit.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;47;better still, for me at least, is the life of the river and the shipyards, where, though rye is now two miles from the sea, ships are still built and the life of the place and its heart are adventured and set upon the great waters.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;47;lovelier by far than rye, not only in itself, but because of what it offers you, those views of hill and marsh and sea with rye itself, like i know not what little masterpiece of flemish art, in the middle distance eastward, winchelsea is a place never to be left or at worst never to be forgotten.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;47;one comes to it from rye on a still afternoon of spring when the faint shadows are beginning to lengthen, expecting little.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;48;like rye, its sister, to whom it looked across the sea, winchelsea was added to the cinque ports and was presently taken from the monks of fecamp by henry iii.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;48;at that time the hill upon which winchelsea was built, and still stands, was washed by the sea, and the harbour soon became of very great importance, indeed until the sixteenth century, when the sea began to retire, winchelsea was of much greater importance than rye.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;48;the retreat of the sea, however, completely ruined it, for it was served by no river as rye was by the rother.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;48;it was attacked and sacked by the french as often as rye, though not always at the same time.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;48;thus in 1377, when rye was half destroyed, winchelsea was saved by the abbot of battle, only to be taken three years later by john de vienne, when the town was burnt.

rye;Secale cereale;organism;PG10120;48;certain it is that until the end of the eighteenth century, there stood to the south-west of the church a great bell tower, a detached campanile, now dismantled, whose stones are said to have been used to build rye harbour.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;2;then one of them, with his mouth full, called out to robin, "hulloa, where goest thou, little lad, with thy one-penny bow and thy farthing shafts?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;2;then robin grew angry, for no stripling likes to be taunted with his green years.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;2;"i'll hold the best of you twenty marks," quoth bold robin, "that i hit the clout at threescore rods, by the good help of our lady fair."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;never a word said robin hood, but he looked at the foresters with a grim face, then, turning on his heel, strode away from them down the forest glade.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;now, well would it have been for him who had first spoken had he left robin hood alone, but his anger was hot, both because the youth had gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts of ale that he had been quaffing.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;and he sent the arrow whistling after robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;it was well for robin hood that that same forester's head was spinning with ale, or else he would never have taken another step.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;3;the shaft flew straight, the archer fell forward with a cry, and lay on his face upon the ground, his arrows rattling about him from out of his quiver, the gray goose shaft wet with his, heart's blood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;then, before the others could gather their wits about them, robin hood was gone into the depths of the greenwood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;meanwhile robin hood ran through the greenwood.

deer;Cervidae;organism;PG10148;3;and so he came to dwell in the greenwood that was to be his home for many a year to come, never again to see the happy days with the lads and lasses of sweet locksley town, for he was outlawed, not only because he had killed a man, but also because he had poached upon the king's deer, and two hundred pounds were set upon his head, as a reward for whoever would bring him to the court of the king.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;now the sheriff of nottingham swore that he himself would bring this knave robin hood to justice, and for two reasons,first, because he wanted the two hundred pounds, and next, because the forester that robin hood had killed was of kin to him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;but robin hood lay hidden in sherwood forest for one year, and in that time there gathered around him many others like himself, cast out from other folk for this cause and for that.

deer;Cervidae;organism;PG10148;3;some had shot deer in hungry wintertime, when they could get no other food, and had been seen in the act by the foresters, but had escaped, thus saving their ears, some had been turned out of their inheritance, that their farms might be added to the king's lands in sherwood forest, some had been despoiled by a great baron or a rich abbot or a powerful esquire--all, for one cause or another, had come to sherwood to escape wrong and oppression.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;3;so, in all that year, fivescore or more good stout yeomen gathered about robin hood, and chose him to be their leader and chief.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;4;besides this, they swore never to harm a child nor to wrong a woman, be she maid, wife, or widow, so that, after a while, when the people began to find that no harm was meant to them, but that money or food came in time of want to many a poor family, they came to praise robin and his merry men, and to tell many tales of him and of his doings in sherwood forest, for they felt him to be one of themselves.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;5;so shrewd was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's-breadth of falling off the bridge, but he regained himself right quickly and, by a dexterous blow, gave robin a crack on the crown that caused the blood to flow.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;5;then robin grew mad with anger and smote with all his might at the other.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;5;but the stranger warded the blow and once again thwacked robin, and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the water, as the queen pin falls in a game of bowls.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;5;"oh, in the flood and floating adown with the tide," cried robin, nor could he forbear laughing himself at his sorry plight.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;5;"why, marry," answered jolly robin, "yon stout fellow hath tumbled me neck and crop into the water and hath given me a drubbing beside."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;5;cried robin, laughing until his sore sides ached again.

yew;Taxus;organism;PG10148;6;"if ye handle yew bow and apple shaft no better than ye do oaken cudgel, i wot ye are not fit to be called yeomen in my country, but if there be any man here that can shoot a better shaft than i, then will i bethink me of joining with you."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;6;"now by my faith," said robin, "thou art a right saucy varlet, sirrah, yet i will stoop to thee as i never stooped to man before.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10148;6;good stutely, cut thou a fair white piece of bark four fingers in breadth, and set it fourscore yards distant on yonder oak.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;6;now, stranger, hit that fairly with a gray goose shaft and call thyself an archer."

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;6;then he chose the stoutest bow among them all, next to robin's own, and a straight gray goose shaft, well-feathered and smooth, and stepping to the mark--while all the band, sitting or lying upon the greensward, watched to see him shoot--he drew the arrow to his cheek and loosed the shaft right deftly, sending it so straight down the path that it clove the mark in the very center.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;6;"that is a keen shot indeed," quoth robin.

yew;Taxus;organism;PG10148;6;"now by the lusty yew bow of good saint withold," cried the stranger,

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;6;"then have i gained a right good man this day," quoth jolly robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;6;then robin hood and all his band laughed aloud until the stranger began to grow angry.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;6;"nay, good friend," said robin hood, "bottle thine anger, for the name fitteth thee well.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;6;then when the feast was ready they all sat down, but robin placed little john at his right hand, for he was henceforth to be the second in the band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;7;then robin took this sweet, pretty babe, clothed him all anew from top to toe in lincoln green, and gave him a good stout bow, and so made him a member of the merry band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;7;and thus it was that robin hood became outlawed, thus a band of merry companions gathered about him, and thus he gained his right-hand man, little john, and so the prologue ends.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;7;and now i will tell how the sheriff of nottingham three times sought to take robin hood, and how he failed each time.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;7;robin hood and the tinker now it was told before how two hundred pounds were set upon robin hood's head, and how the sheriff of nottingham swore that he himself would seize robin, both because he would fain have the two hundred pounds and because the slain man was a kinsman of his own.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;7;now the sheriff did not yet know what a force robin had about him in sherwood, but thought that he might serve a warrant for his arrest as he could upon any other man that had broken the laws, therefore he offered fourscore golden angels to anyone who would serve this warrant.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;7;but men of nottingham town knew more of robin hood and his doings than the sheriff did, and many laughed to think of serving a warrant upon the bold outlaw, knowing well that all they would get for such service would be cracked crowns, so that no one came forward to take the matter in hand.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;7;then said he, "a right good reward have i offered to whosoever would serve my warrant upon robin hood, and i marvel that no one has come to undertake the task."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;7;then one of his men who was near him said, "good master, thou wottest not the force that robin hood has about him and how little he cares for warrant of king or sheriff.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;7;then he called up a messenger in whom he placed great trust, and bade him saddle his horse and make ready to go to lincoln town to see whether he could find anyone there that would do his bidding and win the reward.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;8;the inn looked fair to his eyes, and the shade of the oak trees that stood around it seemed cool and pleasant, so he alighted from his horse to rest himself for a time, calling for a pot of ale to refresh his thirsty throat.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;10;well known was the inn to robin hood and his band, for there had he and such merry companions as little john or will stutely or young david of doncaster often gathered when all the forest was filled with snow.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;10;as for mine host, he knew how to keep a still tongue in his head, and to swallow his words before they passed his teeth, for he knew very well which side of his bread was spread with butter, for robin and his band were the best of customers and paid their scores without having them chalked up behind the door.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;10;so now, when robin hood and the tinker came thereto and called aloud for two great pots of ale, none would have known from look or speech that the host had ever set eyes upon the outlaw before.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;10;"bide thou here," quoth robin to the tinker, "while i go and see that mine host draweth ale from the right butt, for he hath good october, i know, and that brewed by withold of tamworth."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;10;"drink, man, drink," cried robin, only wetting his own lips meanwhile.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;11;then robin hood laughed aloud and quickly took the warrant from out the tinker's pouch with his deft fingers.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;11;"but not yet, i bow, art thou as sly as that same sly thief robin hood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;"robin and i stripped yon ass of his pack main neatly," quoth the landlord.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;now it happened about this time that robin hood was going through the forest to fosse way, to see what was to be seen there, for the moon was full and the night gave promise of being bright.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;12;in his hand he carried his stout oaken staff, and at his side hung his bugle horn.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;each stood still for a time, and then robin spoke,

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;12;"halloa, my sweet bird," said he, laughing merrily, "how likest thou thine ale?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;the tinker said nothing at first but stood looking at robin with a grim face.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;"with all my heart," cried merry robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;he struck two or three blows, but soon found that he had met his match, for robin warded and parried all of them, and, before the tinker thought, he gave him a rap upon the ribs in return.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;at this robin laughed aloud, and the tinker grew more angry than ever, and smote again with all his might and main.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;again robin warded two of the strokes, but at the third, his staff broke beneath the mighty blows of the tinker.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;cried robin, as it fell from his hands, "a foul stick art thou to serve me thus in mine hour of need."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;to this robin hood made no answer, but, clapping his horn to his lips, he blew three blasts, loud and clear.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;12;"an i must drink sour ale, i must," quoth robin, "but never have i yielded me to man before, and that without wound or mark upon my body.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;13;the shooting match at nottingham town then the sheriff was very wroth because of this failure to take jolly robin, for it came to his ears, as ill news always does, that the people laughed at him and made a jest of his thinking to serve a warrant upon such a one as the bold outlaw.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;13;as for yon traitor tinker, him will i hang, if i catch him, upon the very highest gallows tree in all nottinghamshire."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;13;"o good my lord and sovereign," spake the sheriff, "in sherwood forest in our own good shire of nottingham, liveth a bold outlaw whose name is robin hood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;14;not a word did he speak to anyone, and no one of his men spoke to him, but all the time he was busy devising some plan to take robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;14;and mark well my words,before a fortnight is passed, that evil knave robin hood will be safely clapped into nottingham gaol."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;14;at last he thought of the daring soul of jolly robin and how, as he the sheriff knew, he often came even within the walls of nottingham.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;14;"now," thought the sheriff, "could i but persuade robin nigh to nottingham town so that i could find him, i warrant i would lay hands upon him so stoutly that he would never get away again."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;14;then of a sudden it came to him like a flash that were he to proclaim a great shooting match and offer some grand prize, robin hood might be overpersuaded by his spirit to come to the butts, and it was this thought which caused him to cry "aha!"

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;14;and smite his palm upon his thigh.

hamlet;Hypoplectrus;organism;PG10148;14;so, as soon as he had returned safely to nottingham, he sent messengers north and south, and east and west, to proclaim through town, hamlet, and countryside, this grand shooting match, and everyone was bidden that could draw a longbow, and the prize was to be an arrow of pure beaten gold.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;14;when robin hood first heard the news of this he was in lincoln town, and hastening back to sherwood forest he soon called all his merry men about him and spoke to them thus,

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;14;"now," quoth robin, "thou art a wise lad and keepest thine ears open and thy mouth shut, as becometh a wise and crafty woodsman.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;16;then the sheriff leaned forward, looking keenly among the press of archers to find whether robin hood was among them, but no one was there clad in lincoln green, such as was worn by robin and his band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;16;"now," quoth the sheriff to a man-at-arms who stood near him, "seest thou robin hood among those ten?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;16;robin's beard is as yellow as gold, while yon tattered beggar in scarlet hath a beard of brown, besides being blind of one eye.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;16;as for the stranger in blue, robin's shoulders, i ween, are three inches broader than his."

yew;Taxus;organism;PG10148;17;he drew the good yew bow quickly, and quickly loosed a shaft, so short was the time that no man could draw a breath betwixt the drawing and the shooting, yet his arrow lodged nearer the center than the other by twice the length of a barleycorn.

rook;Corvus frugilegus;organism;PG10148;17;straight flew the arrow, and all shouted till the very flags that waved in the breeze shook with the sound, and the rooks and daws flew clamoring about the roofs of the old gray tower, for the shaft had lodged close beside the spot that marked the very center.

yew;Taxus;organism;PG10148;17;meanwhile, also, quite still stood the stranger, holding his bow in his hand, while one could count five, then he drew his trusty yew, holding it drawn but a moment, then loosed the string.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;17;straight flew the arrow, and so true that it smote a gray goose feather from off gilbert's shaft, which fell fluttering through the sunlit air as the stranger's arrow lodged close beside his of the red cap, and in the very center.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;17;i trow thou drawest better bow than that same coward knave robin hood, that dared not show his face here this day.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;17;it was a right motley company that gathered about the noble greenwood tree in sherwood's depths that same day.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;17;a score and more of barefoot friars were there, and some that looked like tinkers, and some that seemed to be sturdy beggars and rustic hinds, and seated upon a mossy couch was one all clad in tattered scarlet, with a patch over one eye, and in his hand he held the golden arrow that was the prize of the great shooting match.

walnut;Juglans;organism;PG10148;17;then, amidst a noise of talking and laughter, he took the patch from off his eye and stripped away the scarlet rags from off his body and showed himself all clothed in fair lincoln green, and quoth he, "easy come these things away, but walnut stain cometh not so speedily from yellow hair."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;then all laughed louder than before, for it was robin hood himself that had won the prize from the sheriff's very hands.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;but when the feast was done, robin hood took little john apart and said,

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;"truly am i vexed in my blood, for i heard the sheriff say today, 'thou shootest better than that coward knave robin hood, that dared not show his face here this day.'

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;"by my troth," said he, "i did reckon full roundly that that knave robin hood would be at the game today.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;18;then everyone saw that it was a blunted gray goose shaft, with a fine scroll, about the thickness of a goose quill, tied near to its head.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;" now heaven bless thy grace this day say all in sweet sherwood for thou didst give the prize away to merry robin hood ."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;will stutely rescued by his companions now when the sheriff found that neither law nor guile could overcome robin hood, he was much perplexed, and said to himself, "fool that i am!

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;had i not told our king of robin hood, i would not have gotten myself into such a coil, but now i must either take him captive or have wrath visited upon my head from his most gracious majesty.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;"now take ye each four men, all armed in proof," said he, "and get ye gone to the forest, at different points, and lie in wait for this same robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;furthermore, to him that first meeteth with robin hood shall one hundred pounds of silver money be given, if he be brought to me dead or alive, and to him that meeteth with any of his band shall twoscore pounds be given, if such be brought to me dead or alive.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;so thus they went in threescore companies of five to sherwood forest, to take robin hood, each constable wishing that he might be the one to find the bold outlaw, or at least one of his band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;for seven days and nights they hunted through the forest glades, but never saw so much as a single man in lincoln green, for tidings of all this had been brought to robin hood by trusty eadom o' the blue boar.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;18;when he first heard the news, robin said, "if the sheriff dare send force to meet force, woe will it be for him and many a better man besides, for blood will flow and there will be great trouble for all.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;19;but they said nothing aloud, swallowing their words and doing as robin bade them.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;19;thus they hid in the depths of sherwood forest for seven days and seven nights and never showed their faces abroad in all that time, but early in the morning of the eighth day robin hood called the band together and said, "now who will go and find what the sheriff's men are at by this time?

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10148;19;then robin hood's heart was proud when he looked around on his stout, brave fellows, and he said, "brave and true are ye all, my merry men, and a right stout band of good fellows are ye, but ye cannot all go, so i will choose one from among you, and it shall be good will stutely, for he is as sly as e'er an old dog fox in sherwood forest."

dog;Canidae;organism;PG10148;19;then robin hood's heart was proud when he looked around on his stout, brave fellows, and he said, "brave and true are ye all, my merry men, and a right stout band of good fellows are ye, but ye cannot all go, so i will choose one from among you, and it shall be good will stutely, for he is as sly as e'er an old dog fox in sherwood forest."

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10148;19;then robin hood's heart was proud when he looked around on his stout, brave fellows, and he said, "brave and true are ye all, my merry men, and a right stout band of good fellows are ye, but ye cannot all go, so i will choose one from among you, and it shall be good will stutely, for he is as sly as e'er an old dog fox in sherwood forest."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;19;then robin hood's heart was proud when he looked around on his stout, brave fellows, and he said, "brave and true are ye all, my merry men, and a right stout band of good fellows are ye, but ye cannot all go, so i will choose one from among you, and it shall be good will stutely, for he is as sly as e'er an old dog fox in sherwood forest."

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;19;then he clad himself in a friar's gown, and underneath the robe he hung a good broadsword in such a place that he could easily lay hands upon it.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;19;thus he sat waiting until he might see the landlord apart, and eadom did not know him, but thought him to be some poor tired friar, so he let him sit without saying a word to him or molesting him, though he liked not the cloth.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10148;19;"for," said he to himself, "it is a hard heart that kicks the lame dog from off the sill."

dog;Canidae;organism;PG10148;19;"for," said he to himself, "it is a hard heart that kicks the lame dog from off the sill."

cat;Felis;organism;PG10148;19;as stutely sat thus, there came a great house cat and rubbed against his knee, raising his robe a palm's-breadth high.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;19;as stutely sat thus, there came a great house cat and rubbed against his knee, raising his robe a palm's-breadth high.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;19;stutely pushed his robe quickly down again, but the constable who commanded the sheriffs men saw what had passed, and saw also fair lincoln green beneath the friar's robe.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;19;he said nothing at the time, but communed within himself in this wise,"yon is no friar of orders gray, and also, i wot, no honest yeoman goeth about in priest's garb, nor doth a thief go so for nought.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;19;now i think in good sooth that is one of robin hood's own men."

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;19;then the constable said again, "whither goest thou, holy friar, upon this hot summer's day?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;19;by my faith, i take thee to be some lusty thief, and perhaps one of robin hood's own band!

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;20;robin hood stood under the greenwood tree, thinking of will stutely and how he might be faring, when suddenly he saw two of his stout yeomen come running down the forest path, and betwixt them ran buxom maken of the blue boar.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;20;robin hood stood under the greenwood tree, thinking of will stutely and how he might be faring, when suddenly he saw two of his stout yeomen come running down the forest path, and betwixt them ran buxom maken of the blue boar.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;20;then robin's heart fell, for he knew they were the bearers of ill tidings.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;20;said robin to the lass.

hare;Lepus;organism;PG10148;20;"ay, marry, for i saw it all," cried she, panting as the hare pants when it has escaped the hounds, "and i fear he is wounded sore, for one smote him main shrewdly i' the crown.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;20;"he shall not be hanged tomorrow day," cried robin, "or, if he be, full many a one shall gnaw the sod, and many shall have cause to cry alack-aday!"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;20;cried robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;20;then, when they had all gathered together at the place of meeting, robin spoke to them thus,

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;20;when robin saw that no other wayfarer was within sight, he called young david of doncaster, who was a shrewd man for his years, and said to him, "now get thee forth, young david, and speak to yonder palmer that walks beside the town wall, for he hath come but now from nottingham town, and may tell thee news of good stutely, perchance."

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;20;so david strode forth, and when he came up to the pilgrim, he saluted him and said, "good morrow, holy father, and canst thou tell me when will stutely will be hanged upon the gallows tree?

barley;Hordeum;organism;PG10148;21;for, though robin hood and his band may be outlaws, yet he taketh only from the rich and the strong and the dishonest man, while there is not a poor widow nor a peasant with many children, nigh to sherwood, but has barley flour enough all the year long through him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;21;for, though robin hood and his band may be outlaws, yet he taketh only from the rich and the strong and the dishonest man, while there is not a poor widow nor a peasant with many children, nigh to sherwood, but has barley flour enough all the year long through him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;21;"if robin and his men be nigh this place, i wot right well they will strive to bring him forth from his peril.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;21;well, well, perchance robin hood is not so far away but that there will be stout doings this day."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;21;when david of doncaster told robin hood what the palmer had said to him, robin called the band around him and spoke to them thus,

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;21;the sun was low in the western sky when a bugle note sounded from the castle wall.

crow;Euploea;organism;PG10148;21;shrive thyself, thou vile knave, for i mean that thou shalt hang this day, and that where three roads meet, so that all men shall see thee hang, for carrion crows and daws to peck at."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;22;such a one as thou art, thou wretched craven, will never be able to subdue bold robin hood."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;22;then he spurred his horse forward and said no more to stutely.

sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG10148;22;then when he saw the slanting sunlight lying on field and fallow, shining redly here and there on cot and farmhouse, and when he heard the sweet birds singing their vespers, and the sheep bleating upon the hillside, and beheld the swallows flying in the bright air, there came a great fullness to his heart so that all things blurred to his sight through salt tears, and he bowed his head lest the folk should think him unmanly when they saw the tears in his eyes.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;22;then when he saw the slanting sunlight lying on field and fallow, shining redly here and there on cot and farmhouse, and when he heard the sweet birds singing their vespers, and the sheep bleating upon the hillside, and beheld the swallows flying in the bright air, there came a great fullness to his heart so that all things blurred to his sight through salt tears, and he bowed his head lest the folk should think him unmanly when they saw the tears in his eyes.

swallow;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10148;22;then when he saw the slanting sunlight lying on field and fallow, shining redly here and there on cot and farmhouse, and when he heard the sweet birds singing their vespers, and the sheep bleating upon the hillside, and beheld the swallows flying in the bright air, there came a great fullness to his heart so that all things blurred to his sight through salt tears, and he bowed his head lest the folk should think him unmanly when they saw the tears in his eyes.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;22;then of a sudden the blood sprang to his cheeks, for he saw for a moment his own good master in the press and, seeing him, knew that robin hood and all his band were there.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;22;so saying, he spurred his horse upon little john, and rising in his stirrups smote with might and main, but little john ducked quickly underneath the horse's belly and the blow whistled harmlessly over his head.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;22;bellowed the sheriff in a voice like an angry bull, and he spurred his horse upon the two who now stood back to back, forgetting in his rage that he had no weapon with which to defend himself.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;22;cried little john, and even as he spoke, a bugle horn sounded shrilly and a clothyard shaft whistled within an inch of the sheriff's head.

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10148;23;"bear back!

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10148;23;bear back!

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;23;thereupon he reined his horse backward through the thickest of the crowd.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;now robin hood and his band might have slain half of the sheriff's men had they desired to do so, but they let them push out of the press and get them gone, only sending a bunch of arrows after them to hurry them in their flight.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;"thou wilt never catch bold robin hood if thou dost not stand to meet him face to face."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;23;but the sheriff, bowing along his horse's back, made no answer but only spurred the faster.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;then robin hood gathered his band together in a close rank, with will stutely in the midst, and thus they moved slowly away toward sherwood, and were gone, as a storm cloud moves away from the spot where a tempest has swept the land.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;thus the sheriff of nottingham tried thrice to take robin hood and failed each time, and the last time he was frightened, for he felt how near he had come to losing his life, so he said, "these men fear neither god nor man, nor king nor king's officers.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;robin hood turns butcher now after all these things had happened, and it became known to robin hood how the sheriff had tried three times to make him captive, he said to himself, "if i have the chance, i will make our worshipful sheriff pay right well for that which he hath done to me.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;23;for when robin hood caught a baron or a squire, or a fat abbot or bishop, he brought them to the greenwood tree and feasted them before he lightened their purses.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;for when robin hood caught a baron or a squire, or a fat abbot or bishop, he brought them to the greenwood tree and feasted them before he lightened their purses.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;but in the meantime robin hood and his band lived quietly in sherwood forest, without showing their faces abroad, for robin knew that it would not be wise for him to be seen in the neighborhood of nottingham, those in authority being very wroth with him.

willow;Salix;organism;PG10148;23;but though they did not go abroad, they lived a merry life within the woodlands, spending the days in shooting at garlands hung upon a willow wand at the end of the glade, the leafy aisles ringing with merry jests and laughter,for whoever missed the garland was given a sound buffet, which, if delivered by little john, never failed to topple over the unfortunate yeoman.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;thus they dwelled for nearly a year, and in that time robin hood often turned over in his mind many means of making an even score with the sheriff.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;"good morrow to thee, jolly fellow," quoth robin, "thou seemest happy this merry morn."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;23;"ha," said robin, "comest thou from locksley town?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;24;"a yeoman am i, and men do call me robin hood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;24;"nay, heaven forbid, indeed," quoth robin, "that i should take from such as thee, jolly fellow!

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;24;but come, tell me for what price thou wilt sell me all of thy meat and thy horse and cart."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;24;then robin hood plucked the purse from his girdle, and quoth he, "here in this purse are six marks.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;24;cried the butcher right joyfully, as he leaped down from his cart and took the purse that robin held out to him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;24;"nay," quoth robin, laughing loudly, "many do like me and wish me well, but few call me honest.

cleaver;Galium aparine;organism;PG10148;24;next, he opened his stall and spread his meat upon the bench, then, taking his cleaver and steel and clattering them together, he trolled aloud in merry tones,

daffodil;Narcissus;organism;PG10148;24;"lamb have i that hath fed upon nought but the dainty dames pied, and the violet sweet, and the daffodil that grow fair streams beside.

cleaver;Galium aparine;organism;PG10148;24;then, when he had finished, he clattered the steel and cleaver still more loudly, shouting lustily, "now, who'll buy?

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;24;four fixed prices have i. three pennyworths of meat i sell to a fat friar or priest for sixpence, for i want not their custom, stout aldermen i charge threepence, for it doth not matter to me whether they buy or not, to buxom dames i sell three pennyworths of meat for one penny for i like their custom well, but to the bonny lass that hath a liking for a good tight butcher i charge nought but one fair kiss, for i like her custom the best of all."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;25;then they began to talk among themselves, and some said, "this must be some thief who has stolen cart, horse, and meat", but others said, "nay, when did ye ever see a thief who parted with his goods so freely and merrily?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;"now, beshrew his heart," quoth jolly robin, "that would deny a butcher.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;when robin and those that were with him came in, all laughing at some merry jest he had been telling them, those that were near the sheriff whispered to him, "yon is a right mad blade, for he hath sold more meat for one penny this day than we could sell for three, and to whatsoever merry lass gave him a kiss he gave meat for nought."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;then the sheriff called robin to him, not knowing him in his butcher's dress, and made him sit close to him on his right hand, for he loved a rich young prodigal--especially when he thought that he might lighten that prodigal's pockets into his own most worshipful purse.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;so he made much of robin, and laughed and talked with him more than with any of the others.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;at last the dinner was ready to be served and the sheriff bade robin say grace, so robin stood up and said, "now heaven bless us all and eke good meat and good sack within this house, and may all butchers be and remain as honest men as i am."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;then he spake aloud to robin, saying, "thou art a jolly young blade, and i love thee mightily", and he smote robin upon the shoulder.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;then robin laughed loudly too.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;"yea," quoth he, "i know thou dost love a jolly blade, for didst thou not have jolly robin hood at thy shooting match and didst thou not gladly give him a bright golden arrow for his own?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;at this the sheriff looked grave and all the guild of butchers too, so that none laughed but robin, only some winked slyly at each other.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;cried robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;who knowest but that thou mayest catch robin hood yet, if thou drinkest less good sack and malmsey, and bringest down the fat about thy paunch and the dust from out thy brain.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;25;"how now, brothers," cried robin, "be merry!

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10148;25;"now thou art a right merry soul," quoth the sheriff, "and i wot thou must have many a head of horned beasts and many an acre of land, that thou dost spend thy money so freely."

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10148;26;"ay, that have i," quoth robin, laughing loudly again, "five hundred and more horned beasts have i and my brothers, and none of them have we been able to sell, else i might not have turned butcher.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;"ay, that have i," quoth robin, laughing loudly again, "five hundred and more horned beasts have i and my brothers, and none of them have we been able to sell, else i might not have turned butcher.

cattle;Bos taurus;organism;PG10148;26;"nay, good youth," quoth he, "if thou canst not sell thy cattle, it may be i will find a man that will lift them from thy hands, perhaps that man may be myself, for i love a merry youth and would help such a one along the path of life.

cattle;Bos taurus;organism;PG10148;26;now how much dost thou want for thy horned cattle?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;"well," quoth robin, "they are worth at least five hundred pounds."

cattle;Bos taurus;organism;PG10148;26;quoth robin, "well thou knowest that so many horned cattle are worth seven hundred pounds and more, and even that is but small for them, and yet thou, with thy gray hairs and one foot in the grave, wouldst trade upon the folly of a wild youth."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;quoth robin, "well thou knowest that so many horned cattle are worth seven hundred pounds and more, and even that is but small for them, and yet thou, with thy gray hairs and one foot in the grave, wouldst trade upon the folly of a wild youth."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;at this the sheriff looked grimly at robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;"nay," quoth robin, "look not on me as though thou hadst sour beer in thy mouth, man.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;"men call me robert o' locksley," quoth bold robin.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10148;26;"then, good robert o' locksley," quoth the sheriff, "i will come this day to see thy horned beasts.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG10148;26;but first my clerk shall draw up a paper in which thou shalt be bound to the sale, for thou gettest not my money without i get thy beasts in return."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;then robin hood laughed again.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;26;"so be it," he said, smiting his palm upon the sheriff's hand.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;26;the afternoon had come when the sheriff mounted his horse and joined robin hood, who stood outside the gateway of the paved court waiting for him, for he had sold his horse and cart to a trader for two marks.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;but all the time the sheriff said within himself, "thy jest to me of robin hood shall cost thee dear, good fellow, even four hundred pounds, thou fool."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;"now," quoth he, "may heaven and its saints preserve us this day from a rogue men call robin hood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;then robin laughed aloud.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;"nay," said he, "thou mayst set thy mind at rest, for well do i know robin hood and well do i know that thou art in no more danger from him this day than thou art from me."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;26;at this the sheriff looked askance at robin, saying to himself, "i like not that thou seemest so well acquainted with this bold outlaw, and i wish that i were well out of sherwood forest."

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;27;so saying, he clapped his bugle to his mouth and winded three merry notes, and presently up the path came leaping fivescore good stout yeomen with little john at their head.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;27;"why," answered robin, "dost thou not see that i have brought goodly company to feast with us today?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;27;then all doffed their hats humbly, without smiling or seeming to be in jest, while little john took the bridle rein and led the palfrey still deeper into the forest, all marching in order, with robin hood walking beside the sheriff, hat in hand.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10148;27;so at last they came to that part of sherwood forest where a noble oak spread its branches wide, and beneath it was a seat all made of moss, on which robin sat down, placing the sheriff at his right hand.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;27;"for," said he to himself, "maybe robin hood hath forgotten all about it."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;27;then, while beyond in the forest bright fires crackled and savory smells of sweetly roasting venison and fat capons filled the glade, and brown pasties warmed beside the blaze, did robin hood entertain the sheriff right royally.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;27;little knowing that the man he called upon was the tinker that tried to serve his warrant upon robin hood.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;27;then several yeomen came forward and spread cloths upon the green grass, and placed a royal feast, while others still broached barrels of sack and malmsey and good stout ale, and set them in jars upon the cloth, with drinking horns about them.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;27;then all sat down and feasted and drank merrily together until the sun was low and the half-moon glimmered with a pale light betwixt the leaves of the trees overhead.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;27;then robin hood and all his merry men arose also, and robin said to the sheriff, "if thou must go, worshipful sir, go thou must, but thou hast forgotten one thing."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;27;"but i say thou hast forgot something," quoth robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;28;"nay," quoth robin seriously, "it would ill beseem us to treat your worship so meanly.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;28;"nay," quoth robin gravely.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;28;quoth robin, "and, as the day waxeth late, i will send one of my young men to guide thee out of the forest depths."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;28;"then i will put thee on the right track mine own self," quoth robin, and, taking the sheriff's horse by the bridle rein, he led him into the main forest path.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;28;then bitterly the sheriff rued the day that first he meddled with robin hood, for all men laughed at him and many ballads were sung by folk throughout the country, of how the sheriff went to shear and came home shorn to the very quick.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;28;at such times archery was always the main sport of the day, for the nottinghamshire yeomen were the best hand at the longbow in all merry england, but this year the sheriff hesitated a long time before he issued proclamation of the fair, fearing lest robin hood and his band might come to it.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;28;at first he had a great part of a mind not to proclaim the fair, but second thought told him that men would laugh at him and say among themselves that he was afraid of robin hood, so he put that thought by.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;29;when robin hood heard what had been proclaimed he was vexed, and said,

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;29;"nay, little john," quoth robin, "thou art a sound stout fellow, yet thou lackest the cunning that good stutely hath, and i would not have harm befall thee for all nottinghamshire.

barley;Hordeum;organism;PG10148;29;in some booths there was dancing to merry music, in others flowed ale and beer, and in others yet again sweet cakes and barley sugar were sold, and sport was going outside the booths also, where some minstrel sang ballads of the olden time, playing a second upon the harp, or where the wrestlers struggled with one another within the sawdust ring, but the people gathered most of all around a raised platform where stout fellows played at quarterstaff.

yew;Taxus;organism;PG10148;29;over his shoulders was slung a stout bow of yew, and across his back hung a quiver of good round arrows.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;29;many turned to look after such a stout, tall fellow, for his shoulders were broader by a palm's-breadth than any that were there, and he stood a head taller than all the other men.

barley;Hordeum;organism;PG10148;30;then, looking up and down the cudgel, he said, "now, i have in my hand but a splint of wood--a barley straw, as it were--yet i trow it will have to serve me, so here goeth."

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;31;"men do call me reynold greenleaf, your worship," said little john, and the old ballad that tells of this, adds, "so, in truth, was he a green leaf, but of what manner of tree the sheriff wotted not."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;31;"now, reynold greenleaf," quoth the sheriff, "thou art the fairest hand at the longbow that mine eyes ever beheld, next to that false knave, robin hood, from whose wiles heaven forfend me!

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;31;"fairly hast thou won the fat steers," said the sheriff, "and hereunto i will add a butt of good march beer, for joy of having gotten such a man, for, i wot, thou shootest as fair a shaft as robin hood himself."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;32;he sat nigh the sheriff at meat, and he ran beside his horse when he went a-hunting, so that, what with hunting and hawking a little, and eating rich dishes and drinking good sack, and sleeping until late hours in the morning, he grew as fat as a stall-fed ox.

woodbine;Lonicera periclymenum;organism;PG10148;32;brightly shone the sun in at the window, and all the air was sweet with the scent of woodbine that hung in sprays about the wall without, for the cold winter was past and spring was come again, and little john lay still, thinking how sweet was everything on this fair morn.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;32;just then he heard, faint and far away, a distant bugle note sounding thin and clear.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;32;his spirit seemed to awaken from its sluggishness, and his memory brought back to him all the merry greenwood life--how the birds were singing blithely there this bright morning, and how his loved companions and friends were feasting and making merry, or perhaps talking of him with sober speech, for when he first entered the sheriff's service he did so in jest, but the hearthstone was warm during the winter, and the fare was full, and so he had abided, putting off from day to day his going back to sherwood, until six long months had passed.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;36;thereupon he told robin hood and his merry men that were there, all that had befallen him since he had left them to go to the fair at nottingham town.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;36;then all shouted with laughter, except robin hood, but he looked grave.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;38;at this reply a great shout of laughter went up, and all looked at robin hood, for each man knew that little john spake of a certain fight that happened between their master and himself, through which they first became acquainted.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;40;now news had been brought to robin hood how that little john, instead of doing his bidding, had passed by duty for pleasure, and so had stopped overnight with merry company at the blue boar inn, instead of going straight to ancaster.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;40;at this, robin hood stopped and listened.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;40;thus spoke robin hood to himself, all his anger passing away like a breath from the windowpane, at the thought that perhaps his trusty right-hand man was in some danger of his life.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;40;quoth robin to himself, "here is merry sport afoot.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10148;41;as you may have seen two dogs that think to fight, walking slowly round and round each other, neither cur wishing to begin the combat, so those two stout yeomen moved slowly around, each watching for a chance to take the other unaware, and so get in the first blow.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;41;"and so thought i, also," cried robin hood, bursting out of the thicket and shouting with laughter till the tears ran down his cheeks.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;41;so spoke bold robin, and all the time little john sat upon the ground, looking as though he had sour curds in his mouth.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;said robin, next, turning to the tanner.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;quoth robin, "i have heard thy name before, good fellow.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;his name is little john, and mine robin hood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;cried the tanner, "art thou indeed the great robin hood, and is this the famous little john?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;at this robin laughed again, and, turning to the tanner, he said, "wilt thou join my band, good arthur?

deer;Cervidae;organism;PG10148;42;i will follow thee to the ends of the earth, good master, and not a herd of dun deer in all the forest but shall know the sound of the twang of my bowstring."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;"as for thee, little john," said robin, turning to him and laughing,

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;robin hood and will scarlet thus they traveled along the sunny road, three stout fellows such as you could hardly match anywhere else in all merry england.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;quoth robin hood to little john, "why didst thou not go straight to ancaster, yesterday, as i told thee?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;"i feared the rain that threatened," said little john in a sullen tone, for he was vexed at being so chaffed by robin with what had happened to him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;cried robin, stopping of a sudden in the middle of the road, and looking at little john in wonder.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;at this robin hood burst into a roar of laughter.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;42;after they had traveled some distance, the day being warm and the road dusty, robin hood waxed thirsty, so, there being a fountain of water as cold as ice, just behind the hedgerow, they crossed the stile and came to where the water bubbled up from beneath a mossy stone.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;42;here, kneeling and making cups of the palms of their hands, they drank their fill, and then, the spot being cool and shady, they stretched their limbs and rested them for a space.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;42;in front of them, over beyond the hedge, the dusty road stretched away across the plain, behind them the meadow lands and bright green fields of tender young corn lay broadly in the sun, and overhead spread the shade of the cool, rustling leaves of the beechen tree.

thyme;Thymus (Lamiaceae);organism;PG10148;43;pleasantly to their nostrils came the tender fragrance of the purple violets and wild thyme that grew within the dewy moisture of the edge of the little fountain, and pleasantly came the soft gurgle of the water.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;43;all was so pleasant and so full of the gentle joy of the bright maytime, that for a long time no one of the three cared to speak, but each lay on his back, gazing up through the trembling leaves of the trees to the bright sky overhead.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;43;at last, robin, whose thoughts were not quite so busy woolgathering as those of the others, and who had been gazing around him now and then, broke the silence.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;43;quoth he, "yon is a gaily feathered bird, i take my vow."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;43;gay was he, indeed, as robin had said, and a fine figure he cut, for his doublet was of scarlet silk and his stockings also, a handsome sword hung by his side, the embossed leathern scabbard being picked out with fine threads of gold, his cap was of scarlet velvet, and a broad feather hung down behind and back of one ear.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10148;43;his hair was long and yellow and curled upon his shoulders, and in his hand he bore an early rose, which he smelled at daintily now and then.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;43;quoth robin hood, laughing, "saw ye e'er such a pretty, mincing fellow?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;43;quoth robin hood, "the sight of such a fellow doth put a nasty taste into my mouth!

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10148;43;look how he doth hold that fair flower betwixt his thumb and finger, as he would say, 'good rose, i like thee not so ill but i can bear thy odor for a little while.'

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;43;"nay," said robin, "my head against a leaden farthing, he is what i say.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;43;so saying, robin hood stepped forth from the shade of the beech tree, crossed the stile, and stood in the middle of the road, with his hands on his hips, in the stranger's path.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;43;meantime the stranger, who had been walking so slowly that all this talk was held before he came opposite the place where they were, neither quickened his pace nor seemed to see that such a man as robin hood was in the world.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10148;43;so robin stood in the middle of the road, waiting while the other walked slowly forward, smelling his rose, and looking this way and that, and everywhere except at robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;44;cried robin, when at last the other had come close to him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;44;"then," quoth robin, "as thou dost so fairly do as i tell thee, and dost give me such soft speech, i will also treat thee with all due courtesy.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10148;44;all this time the youth had been sniffing at the rose that he held betwixt his thumb and finger.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;44;"nay," said he with a gentle smile, when robin hood had done, "i do love to hear thee talk, thou pretty fellow, and if, haply, thou art not yet done, finish, i beseech thee.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;44;"i have said all," quoth robin, "and now, if thou wilt give me thy purse, i will let thee go thy way without let or hindrance so soon as i shall see what it may hold.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;44;"nay, thou goest not," quoth robin, "till thou hast shown me thy purse."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;44;"i have spoken to thee, friend," said robin sternly, "and i now tell thee again, that thou goest not one step forward till thou hast done as i bid thee."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;44;"put by thy weapon," quoth robin.

barley;Hordeum;organism;PG10148;44;i could snap it like a barley straw.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;44;first the stranger measured robin with his eye, and then he measured the oaken staff.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10148;44;so saying, he threw aside the rose that he had been holding all this time, thrust his sword back into the scabbard, and, with a more hasty step than he had yet used, stepped to the roadside where grew the little clump of ground oaks robin had spoken of.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;44;he did not cut it, but, rolling up his sleeves a little way, he laid hold of it, placed his heel against the ground, and, with one mighty pull, plucked the young tree up by the roots from out the very earth.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;whatever robin hood thought, he stood his ground, and now he and the stranger in scarlet stood face to face.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;well did robin hood hold his own that day as a mid-country yeoman.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;this way and that they fought, and back and forth, robin's skill against the stranger's strength.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;thrice robin hood struck the stranger, once upon the arm and twice upon the ribs, and yet had he warded all the other's blows, only one of which, had it met its mark, would have laid stout robin lower in the dust than he had ever gone before.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;at last the stranger struck robin's cudgel so fairly in the middle that he could hardly hold his staff in his hand, again he struck, and robin bent beneath the blow, a third time he struck, and now not only fairly beat down robin's guard, but gave him such a rap, also, that down he tumbled into the dusty road.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;cried robin hood, when he saw the stranger raising his staff once more.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;cried robin hood, "we will fight no more.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;then little john turned to robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;cried robin angrily.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;quoth robin in a fume.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;cried robin, "is it even so?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;"there was i born and bred, and thence i come to seek my mother's young brother, whom men call robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;cried robin, placing both hands upon the other's shoulders and holding him off at arm's length.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;cried the other, "i do believe from my heart that thou art mine own uncle robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;45;then once more robin held his kinsman off at arm's length and scanned him keenly from top to toe.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;46;dost thou not remember, lad, how i showed thee the proper way to nip the goose feather betwixt thy fingers and throw out thy bow arm steadily?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;46;"no, no," quoth robin hastily, and looking sideways at little john,

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;46;i take my vow, i felt my stomach quake when i beheld thee pluck up yon green tree as thou didst.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;46;"well, by the faith of my heart," quoth robin hood, "for anyone escaping the law, thou wast taking it the most easily that ever i beheld in all my life.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;46;"nay," quoth robin, "let us say no more on that score.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;46;"will scarlet," quoth little john, stepping forward and reaching out his great palm, which the other took, "will scarlet, the name fitteth thee well.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;46;thou art like to achieve fame, will, let me tell thee, for there will be many a merry ballad sung about the country, and many a merry story told in sherwood of how robin hood taught little john and arthur a bland the proper way to use the quarterstaff, likewise, as it were, how our good master bit off so large a piece of cake that he choked on it."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;46;"nay, good little john," quoth robin gently, for he liked ill to have such a jest told of him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;"nay, good little john," said robin hastily, "i do bethink me i have said full enough on that score."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;"nay, then," said robin hood testily, "i was mistaken.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;cried robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;"come," cried robin, biting his nether lip, while the others could not forbear laughing.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;so said robin, for now that his bones were sore, he felt as though a long journey would be an ill thing for him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;quoth robin hood, "i would that i had somewhat to eat.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;"why, so thou hast, little john," said robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;"then give him six pennies, little john," quoth robin, "for methinks food for three men will about fit my need.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;47;then robin hood took a deep pull at the beer.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;52;so that night all was ablaze with crackling fires in the woodlands, for though robin and those others spoken of, only excepting midge, the miller's son, had many a sore bump and bruise here and there on their bodies, they were still not so sore in the joints that they could not enjoy a jolly feast given all in welcome to the new members of the band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;53;but little john's tongue was ever one that was not easy of guidance, so that, inch by inch, the whole story of his fight with the tanner and robin's fight with will scarlet leaked out.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;53;robin hood and allan a dale it has just been told how three unlucky adventures fell upon robin hood and little john all in one day bringing them sore ribs and aching bones.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;53;so next we will tell how they made up for those ill happenings by a good action that came about not without some small pain to robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;53;two days had passed by, and somewhat of the soreness had passed away from robin hood's joints, yet still, when he moved of a sudden and without thinking, pain here and there would, as it were, jog him, crying, "thou hast had a drubbing, good fellow."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;53;"by the faith of my heart," quoth merry robin, "i do bethink me that we have had no one to dine with us for this long time.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;53;at this all laughed but little john and robin, who twisted up his face.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;53;so, having chosen four more stout fellows, will stutely and his band set forth to fosse way, to find whether they might not come across some rich guest to feast that day in sherwood with robin and his band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;55;"good even, fair friend," said robin hood, rising as the other drew near.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;55;"nay, marry," quoth robin, laughing, "thou art awake, as thou wilt presently find, for a fine feast is a-cooking for thee.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;55;presently he turned to robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;55;"thou hast hit the bull's eye," quoth robin, clapping him upon the shoulder.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;55;at this speech a great shout of laughter went up from those around, whereat the poor boy looked as he would die of shame, but robin hood turned sharply to will stutely.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;55;then up spoke will scarlet, and told how they had found the lad in sorrow, and how he had brought him to robin, thinking that he might perchance aid him in his trouble.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;55;then robin hood turned to the youth, and, placing his hand upon the other's shoulder, held him off at arm's length, scanning his face closely.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;55;"nay, nay," said robin hastily, "cheer up, lad, i warrant thy case is not so bad that it cannot be mended.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;56;then, when the others had gone, each man about his business, robin turned once more to the youth.

snowdrop;Galanthus nivalis;organism;PG10148;56;so he told them how he had come from york to the sweet vale of rother, traveling the country through as a minstrel, stopping now at castle, now at hall, and now at farmhouse, how he had spent one sweet evening in a certain broad, low farmhouse, where he sang before a stout franklin and a maiden as pure and lovely as the first snowdrop of spring, how he had played and sung to her, and how sweet ellen o' the dale had listened to him and had loved him.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;56;"i wonder not," said robin, after a moment's silence, "that thy true love loved thee, for thou hast surely a silver cross beneath thy tongue, even like good saint francis, that could charm the birds of the air by his speech."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;57;"then give me thy hand, allan," cried robin, "and let me tell thee, i swear by the bright hair of saint aelfrida that this time two days hence ellen a dale shall be thy wife.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;57;i will seek this same friar of fountain abbey tomorrow day, and i warrant i will get upon the soft side of him, even if i have to drub one soft."

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;60;having gotten his breath from his last draught, the friar began talking again in this wise,"now, sweet lad, canst thou not sing me a song?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;61;so they sang together, for the stout friar did not seem to have heard robin's laughter, neither did he seem to know that the yeoman had joined in with the song, but, with eyes half closed, looking straight before him and wagging his round head from side to side in time to the music, he kept on bravely to the end, he and robin finishing up with a mighty roar that might have been heard a mile.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;61;hereupon he drew from beneath his robes a great broadsword full as stout as was robin's.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;asked robin, laughing.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;62;"then perchance thou knowest also of a certain one who goeth by the name of the curtal friar of fountain abbey."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;"well then, good fellow, holy father, or whatever thou art," quoth robin, "i would know whether this same friar is to be found upon this side of the river or the other."

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;62;"that," quoth the friar, "is a practical question upon which the cunning rules appertaining to logic touch not.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;"i do wish much," quoth robin, looking thoughtfully at the stout priest,

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;62;"to cross yon ford and strive to find this same good friar."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;"yea, good father," said robin, "but thou seest that my clothes are of the finest and i fain would not get them wet.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;62;burst forth the friar in a mighty rage, "dost thou, thou poor puny stripling, thou kiss-my-lady-la poppenjay, thou--thou what shall i call thee?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;so saying, he clambered up the bank, closely followed by robin, and led the way to the shallow pebbly ford, chuckling to himself the while as though he were enjoying some goodly jest within himself.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;having come to the ford, he girded up his robes about his loins, tucked his good broadsword beneath his arm, and stooped his back to take robin upon it.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;"nay, good father," said robin, "i would not burden thee with aught of mine but myself."

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;62;"dost thou think," said the friar mildly, "that the good saint christopher would ha' sought his own ease so?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;upon this, without more ado, robin hood unbuckled his sword from his side and handed it to the other, who thrust it with his own beneath his arm.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;then once more the friar bent his back, and, robin having mounted upon it, he stepped sturdily into the water and so strode onward, splashing in the shoal, and breaking all the smooth surface into everwidening rings.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;62;at last he reached the other side and robin leaped lightly from his back.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;63;thus it came about that, by the time he had reached the other bank with his load, the friar's sword belt was loose albeit he knew it not, so when robin stood on dry land and the friar leaped from his back, the yeoman gripped hold of the sword so that blade, sheath, and strap came away from the holy man, leaving him without a weapon.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;63;here he stopped for a moment, and then, with a sudden lift of his hand and heave of his shoulders, fairly shot robin over his head as though he were a sack of grain.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;63;down went robin into the water with a mighty splash.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;63;meantime, after much splashing, robin had gotten to his feet and stood gazing about him all bewildered, the water running from him in pretty little rills.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;63;at last he shot the water out of his ears and spat some out of his mouth, and, gathering his scattered wits together, saw the stout friar standing on the bank and laughing.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;63;then, i wot, was robin hood a mad man.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;64;"now i crave a boon ere we begin again," quoth robin, wiping the sweat from his brow, for they had striven so long that he began to think that it would be an ill-done thing either to be smitten himself or to smite so stout and brave a fellow.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;66;"well, what an there be," said robin, "it is mine own coin and the band is none the worse for what is there.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;66;then gathering the score together in a close rank, in the midst of which were allan a dale and friar tuck, he led them forth upon their way from the forest shades.

sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG10148;66;here were different sights from what one saw in the forest, hedgerows, broad fields of barley corn, pasture lands rolling upward till they met the sky and all dotted over with flocks of white sheep, hayfields whence came the odor of new-mown hay that lay in smooth swathes over which skimmed the swifts in rapid flight, such they saw, and different was it, i wot, from the tangled depths of the sweet woodlands, but full as fair.

barley;Hordeum;organism;PG10148;66;here were different sights from what one saw in the forest, hedgerows, broad fields of barley corn, pasture lands rolling upward till they met the sky and all dotted over with flocks of white sheep, hayfields whence came the odor of new-mown hay that lay in smooth swathes over which skimmed the swifts in rapid flight, such they saw, and different was it, i wot, from the tangled depths of the sweet woodlands, but full as fair.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;66;thus robin led his band, walking blithely with chest thrown out and head thrown back, snuffing the odors of the gentle breeze that came drifting from over the hayfields.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;66;"nay," said friar tuck piously, "ye do think of profane things and of nought else, yet, truly, there be better safeguards against care and woe than ale drinking and bright eyes, to wit, fasting and meditation.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;66;at this a great shout of laughter went up from all around, for the night before the stout friar had emptied twice as many canakins of ale as any one of all the merry men.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;66;"truly," quoth robin, when he could speak for laughter, "i should say that thy sorrows were about equal to thy goodliness."

barley;Hordeum;organism;PG10148;67;on the other side of the road from where the church stood with waving fields of barley around, ran a stone wall along the roadside.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;67;over the wall from the highway was a fringe of young trees and bushes, and here and there the wall itself was covered by a mass of blossoming woodbine that filled all the warm air far and near with its sweet summer odor.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10148;67;over the wall from the highway was a fringe of young trees and bushes, and here and there the wall itself was covered by a mass of blossoming woodbine that filled all the warm air far and near with its sweet summer odor.

woodbine;Lonicera periclymenum;organism;PG10148;67;over the wall from the highway was a fringe of young trees and bushes, and here and there the wall itself was covered by a mass of blossoming woodbine that filled all the warm air far and near with its sweet summer odor.

sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG10148;67;then straightway the yeomen leaped over the wall, alighting on the tall soft grass upon the other side, frightening a flock of sheep that lay there in the shade so that they scampered away in all directions.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;67;then straightway the yeomen leaped over the wall, alighting on the tall soft grass upon the other side, frightening a flock of sheep that lay there in the shade so that they scampered away in all directions.

grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10148;67;then straightway the yeomen leaped over the wall, alighting on the tall soft grass upon the other side, frightening a flock of sheep that lay there in the shade so that they scampered away in all directions.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;67;here was a sweet cool shadow both from the wall and from the fair young trees and bushes, and here sat the yeomen down, and glad enough they were to rest after their long tramp of the morning.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;67;"now," quoth robin, "i would have one of you watch and tell me when he sees anyone coming to the church, and the one i choose shall be young david of doncaster.

woodbine;Lonicera periclymenum;organism;PG10148;67;so get thee upon the wall, david, and hide beneath the woodbine so as to keep watch."

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;67;accordingly young david did as he was bidden, the others stretching themselves at length upon the grass, some talking together and others sleeping.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;67;then all was quiet save only for the low voices of those that talked together, and for allan's restless footsteps pacing up and down, for his soul was so full of disturbance that he could not stand still, and saving, also, for the mellow snoring of friar tuck, who enjoyed his sleep with a noise as of one sawing soft wood very slowly.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;67;robin lay upon his back and gazed aloft into the leaves of the trees, his thought leagues away, and so a long time passed.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;67;robin lay upon his back and gazed aloft into the leaves of the trees, his thought leagues away, and so a long time passed.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;67;then up spoke robin, "now tell us, young david of doncaster, what dost thou see?"

crow;Euploea;organism;PG10148;67;then david answered, "i see the white clouds floating and i feel the wind a-blowing and three black crows are flying over the wold, but nought else do i see, good master."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;67;so silence fell again and another time passed, broken only as i have said, till robin, growing impatient, spake again.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;67;and david answered, "i see the windmills swinging and three tall poplar trees swaying against the sky, and a flock of fieldfares are flying over the hill, but nought else do i see, good master."

poplar;Populus;organism;PG10148;67;and david answered, "i see the windmills swinging and three tall poplar trees swaying against the sky, and a flock of fieldfares are flying over the hill, but nought else do i see, good master."

fieldfare;Turdus pilaris;organism;PG10148;67;and david answered, "i see the windmills swinging and three tall poplar trees swaying against the sky, and a flock of fieldfares are flying over the hill, but nought else do i see, good master."

windmill;Allionia;organism;PG10148;67;and david answered, "i see the windmills swinging and three tall poplar trees swaying against the sky, and a flock of fieldfares are flying over the hill, but nought else do i see, good master."

barley;Hordeum;organism;PG10148;67;so another time passed, till at last robin asked young david once more what he saw, and david said, "i hear the cuckoo singing, and i see how the wind makes waves in the barley field, and now over the hill to the church cometh an old friar, and in his hands he carries a great bunch of keys, and lo!

cuckoo;Cuculidae;organism;PG10148;67;so another time passed, till at last robin asked young david once more what he saw, and david said, "i hear the cuckoo singing, and i see how the wind makes waves in the barley field, and now over the hill to the church cometh an old friar, and in his hands he carries a great bunch of keys, and lo!

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;67;then up rose robin hood and shook friar tuck by the shoulder.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;67;then up rose robin hood and shook friar tuck by the shoulder.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;67;"marry, bestir thyself," quoth robin, "for yonder, in the church door, is one of thy cloth.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;67;so friar tuck clambered over the wall, crossed the road, and came to the church, where the old friar was still laboring with the great key, the lock being somewhat rusty and he somewhat old and feeble.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;67;asked the old friar, in a high, wheezing voice.

owl;Strigiformes;organism;PG10148;67;and he winked and blinked at stout friar tuck like an owl at the sun.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;67;and he winked and blinked at stout friar tuck like an owl at the sun.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;meantime, robin hood, in his guise of harper, together with little john and will stutely, had come to the church.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;robin sat him down on a bench beside the door, but little john, carrying the two bags of gold, went within, as did will stutely.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;so robin sat by the door, looking up the road and down the road to see who might come, till, after a time, he saw six horsemen come riding sedately and slowly, as became them, for they were churchmen in high orders.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;then, when they had come nearer, robin saw who they were, and knew them.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;when robin saw this train drawing near, with flash of jewels and silk and jingle of silver bells on the trappings of the nags, he looked sourly upon them.

golden chain;Laburnum anagyroides;organism;PG10148;68;i do wonder whether his patron, who, methinks, was saint thomas, was given to wearing golden chains about his neck, silk clothing upon his body, and pointed shoes upon his feet, the money for all of which, god wot, hath been wrung from the sweat of poor tenants.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;then they dismounted, and the bishop, looking around, presently caught sight of robin standing in the doorway.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;"a harper am i from the north country," quoth robin, "and i can touch the strings, i wot, as never another man in all merry england can do.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;and he looked keenly at robin, who gazed boldly back again into his eyes.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;"nay," quoth robin, "my music cometh not without i choose, even at a lord bishop's bidding.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;"now, thou art a saucy varlet to speak so to my crest," quoth the bishop, frowning on robin.

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10148;68;"yet, i must needs bear with thee.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;68;and now, around the bend of the highroad, came others, riding upon horses.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;robin looked, and had no doubt that this was sir stephen, both because of his knightly carriage and of his gray hairs.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;68;beside him rode a stout saxon franklin, ellen's father, edward of deirwold, behind those two came a litter borne by two horses, and therein was a maiden whom robin knew must be ellen.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;68;beside him rode a stout saxon franklin, ellen's father, edward of deirwold, behind those two came a litter borne by two horses, and therein was a maiden whom robin knew must be ellen.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;69;so these also came to the church, and there sir stephen leaped from his horse and, coming to the litter, handed fair ellen out therefrom.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;69;then robin hood looked at her, and could wonder no longer how it came about that so proud a knight as sir stephen of trent wished to marry a common franklin's daughter, nor did he wonder that no ado was made about the matter, for she was the fairest maiden that ever he had beheld.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10148;69;now, however, she was all pale and drooping, like a fair white lily snapped at the stem, and so, with bent head and sorrowful look, she went within the church, sir stephen leading her by the hand.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;69;quoth the bishop, looking sternly at robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;69;"marry," said robin calmly, "i will play in greater wise than your lordship thinks, but not till the right time hath come."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;69;said the bishop to himself, while he looked grimly at robin, "when this wedding is gone by i will have this fellow well whipped for his saucy tongue and bold speech."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;69;then, in all his fluttering tags and ribbons of red and yellow, robin hood strode forward.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10148;69;here be lilies in the cheeks, and not roses such as befit a bonny bride.

lily;Lilium;organism;PG10148;69;here be lilies in the cheeks, and not roses such as befit a bonny bride.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;69;at this all stood amazed, and knew not where to look nor what to think or say, for they were all bewildered with the happening, so, while everyone looked at robin as though they had been changed to stone, he clapped his bugle horn to his lips and blew three blasts so loud and clear, they echoed from floor to rafter as though they were sounded by the trump of doom.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;69;then straightway little john and will stutely came leaping and stood upon either side of robin hood, and quickly drew their broadswords, the while a mighty voice rolled over the heads of all,

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;69;"here be i, good master, when thou wantest me", for it was friar tuck that so called from the organ loft.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;69;"thou art a hobbled horse this day."

yew;Taxus;organism;PG10148;69;in his hand he bore robin hood's good stout trusty bow of yew, and this he gave to him, kneeling the while upon one knee.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;69;"nay," quoth merry robin, "that have i done, and i care not who knoweth it, for my name is robin hood."

wolf;Canis lupus;organism;PG10148;69;the prior of emmet and those that belonged to him gathered together like a flock of frightened sheep when the scent of the wolf is nigh, while the bishop of hereford, laying aside his book, crossed himself devoutly.

sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG10148;69;the prior of emmet and those that belonged to him gathered together like a flock of frightened sheep when the scent of the wolf is nigh, while the bishop of hereford, laying aside his book, crossed himself devoutly.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;69;"nay," quoth robin, "i mean you no harm, but here is fair ellen's betrothed husband, and she shall marry him or pain will be bred to some of you."

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;70;only friar tuck leaned over the edge of the choir loft and called out to him ere he had gone,

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;70;but robin hood laid hold of his clothes and held him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;70;the bishop's face fell, but he stayed as robin bade him, for he saw he could not go.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;70;then robin hood turned to stout edward of deirwold, and said he, "give thy blessing on thy daughter's marriage to this yeoman, and all will be well.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;70;give not thy blessing, and she shall be married all the same, but not so much as a cracked farthing shall cross thy palm.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;70;and now robin counted out two hundred golden angels to edward of deirwold, and he, upon his part, gave his blessing, yet not, i wot, as though he meant it with overmuch good will.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;70;then the stout yeomen crowded around and grasped allan's palm, and he, holding ellen's hand within his own, looked about him all dizzy with his happiness.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;70;then at last jolly robin turned to the bishop of hereford, who had been looking on at all that passed with a grim look.

golden chain;Laburnum anagyroides;organism;PG10148;70;thou hast upon thee that which, methinks, thou wouldst be the better without, therefore, i prythee, give me that golden chain that hangeth about thy neck as a wedding present for this fair bride."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;he looked at robin with a fell look, but saw that in the yeoman's face which bade him pause.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;then slowly he took the chain from about his neck and handed it to robin, who flung it over ellen's head so that it hung glittering about her shoulders.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;then said merry robin, "i thank thee, on the bride's part, for thy handsome gift, and truly thou thyself art more seemly without it.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;cried the bishop earnestly, for he knew right well what manner of feast it was that robin hood gave his guests in sherwood forest.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;but now robin hood gathered his men together, and, with allan and his young bride in their midst, they all turned their footsteps toward the woodlands.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;on the way thither friar tuck came close to robin and plucked him by the sleeve.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;71;on the way thither friar tuck came close to robin and plucked him by the sleeve.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;at this merry robin hood laughed amain, and bade him stay and become one of their band if he wished.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;robin hood aids a sorrowful knight so passed the gentle springtime away in budding beauty, its silver showers and sunshine, its green meadows and its flowers.

frog;Anura;organism;PG10148;71;so, likewise, passed the summer with its yellow sunlight, its quivering heat and deep, bosky foliage, its long twilights and its mellow nights, through which the frogs croaked and fairy folk were said to be out on the hillsides.

crab;Pthirus;organism;PG10148;71;brown ale lies ripening in the cellar, hams and bacon hang in the smoke-shed, and crabs are stowed away in the straw for roasting in the wintertime, when the north wind piles the snow in drifts around the gables and the fire crackles warm upon the hearth.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;71;so passed the seasons then, so they pass now, and so they will pass in time to come, while we come and go like leaves of the tree that fall and are soon forgotten.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;quoth robin hood, snuffing the air, "here is a fair day, little john, and one that we can ill waste in idleness.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;71;choose such men as thou dost need, and go thou east while i will wend to the west, and see that each of us bringeth back some goodly guest to dine this day beneath the greenwood tree."

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;71;"marry," cried little john, clapping his palms together for joy, "thy bidding fitteth my liking like heft to blade.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;now, you and i cannot go two ways at the same time while we join in these merry doings, so we will e'en let little john follow his own path while we tuck up our skirts and trudge after robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;and here is good company, too, robin hood, will scarlet, allan a dale, will scathelock, midge, the miller's son, and others.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;a score or more of stout fellows had abided in the forest, with friar tuck, to make ready for the homecoming, but all the rest were gone either with robin hood or little john.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;71;a score or more of stout fellows had abided in the forest, with friar tuck, to make ready for the homecoming, but all the rest were gone either with robin hood or little john.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;71;they traveled onward, robin following his fancy and the others following robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;by this time high noontide had come, yet they had met no guest such as was worth their while to take back to sherwood, so, coming at last to a certain spot where a shrine stood at the crossing of two roads, robin called upon them to stop, for here on either side was shelter of high hedgerows, behind which was good hiding, whence they could watch the roads at their ease, while they ate their midday meal.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;quoth merry robin, "here, methinks, is good lodging, where peaceful folk, such as we be, can eat in quietness, therefore we will rest here, and see what may, perchance, fall into our luck-pot."

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;72;so they crossed a stile and came behind a hedgerow where the mellow sunlight was bright and warm, and where the grass was soft, and there sat them down.

grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10148;72;so they crossed a stile and came behind a hedgerow where the mellow sunlight was bright and warm, and where the grass was soft, and there sat them down.

windmill;Allionia;organism;PG10148;72;over the top of the windy hill peeped the eaves of a few houses of the village that fell back into the valley behind, there, also, showed the top of a windmill, the sails slowly rising and dipping from behind the hill against the clear blue sky, as the light wind moved them with creaking and labored swing.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;at last, a man came slowly riding over the hill and down the stony road toward the spot where robin and his band lay hidden.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;72;his head was bowed upon his breast and his hands drooped limp on either side, and so he came slowly riding, as though sunk in sad thoughts, while even his good horse, the reins loose upon his neck, walked with hanging head, as though he shared his master's grief.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;quoth robin hood, "yon is verily a sorry-looking gallant, and doth seem to have donned ill-content with his jerkin this morning, nevertheless, i will out and talk with him, for there may be some pickings here for a hungry daw.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;so, presently, when the knight came riding slowly along, jolly robin stepped forward and laid his hand upon the bridle rein.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;"marry," quoth robin, "that is a question hard to answer.

toad;Bufo;organism;PG10148;72;truly, the world hath as many eyes to look upon a man withal as there are spots on a toad, so, with what pair of eyes thou regardest me lieth entirely with thine own self.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;my name is robin hood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;"truly, good robin," said the knight, a smile twitching at the corners of his mouth, "thou hast a quaint conceit.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;72;"now, i make my vow, sir knight," quoth robin, "thou hast surely learned thy wisdom of good gaffer swanthold, for he sayeth, 'fair words are as easy spoke as foul, and bring good will in the stead of blows.'

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;"nay," quoth robin, "thou mightst go thine own way but for one thing, and that i will tell thee.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;said robin, looking at the knight keenly.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;73;then, still holding the horse by the bridle rein, he put his fingers to his lips and blew a shrill whistle, whereupon fourscore yeomen came leaping over the stile and ran to where the knight and robin stood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;"these," said robin, looking upon them proudly, "are some of my merry men.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;for a time the knight said not a word, but a slow red arose into his cheeks, at last he looked robin in the face and said, "i know not why i should be ashamed, for it should be no shame to me, but, friend, i tell thee the truth, when i say that in my purse are ten shillings, and that that is every groat that sir richard of the lea hath in all the wide world."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;when sir richard ended a silence fell, until at last robin said, "and dost thou pledge me thy knightly word that this is all thou hast with thee?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;after they had traveled thus for a time robin hood spake.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;"truly, robin," quoth the knight, "i see no reason why i should not do so.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;quoth robin, "i understand not why those of thy kind live in such a manner that all their wealth passeth from them like snow beneath the springtide sun."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;73;"thou wrongest me, robin," said the knight, "for listen,i have a son but twenty winters old, nevertheless he has won his spurs as knight.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;74;now, robin, sir walter had great friends at court, therefore his kinsmen stirred up things against my son so that, to save him from prison, i had to pay a ransom of six hundred pounds in gold.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;74;asked robin, who had listened closely to all the knight had said.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;74;"truly," said robin, much moved, "thine is a hard lot.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;74;at this, robin smote his thigh in anger.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;74;i make no boast, but many have found robin hood a friend in their troubles.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;74;the knight shook his head with a faint smile, but for all that, robin's words made him more blithe of heart, for in truth hope, be it never so faint, bringeth a gleam into darkness, like a little rushlight that costeth but a groat.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;74;when the bishop saw robin and those with him come into the open he made as though he would have run toward the yeoman, but the fellow that guarded the bishop and the three friars thrust his quarterstaff in front, so that his lordship was fain to stand back, though with frowning brow and angry speech.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;75;"stay, my lord bishop," cried jolly robin in a loud voice, when he saw what had passed, "i will come to thee with all speed, for i would rather see thee than any man in merry england."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;75;"how now," quoth the bishop in a loud and angry voice, when robin had so come to him, "is this the way that thou and thy band treat one so high in the church as i am?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;75;but look ye, not only did this fellow stop me, but he threatened me, saying that robin hood would strip me as bare as a winter hedge.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;75;"and didst thou, little john," said robin in a sad voice, "call his lordship a fat priest?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;75;said jolly robin, turning to the bishop, "for i have ever found little john a truthful man."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;75;"nay, my lord bishop," said robin, "we are rough fellows, but i trust not such ill men as thou thinkest, after all.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;75;then robin brought forward sir richard of the lea.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;75;"sir richard," said the bishop in a reproachful tone, "methinks thou and i are companions and fellow sufferers in this den of--" he was about to say "thieves," but he stopped suddenly and looked askance at robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;76;and all the while robin talked so quaintly to the bishop and the knight that, the one forgetting his vexation and the other his troubles, they both laughed aloud again and again.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;76;then robin hood called aloud for silence, and all was hushed till he spoke.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;76;then, when robin hood had done, he turned to the bishop of hereford.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;76;quoth robin, "now, thou art the richest bishop in all england, canst thou not help this needy brother?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;76;quoth robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;so this, too, was done as robin hood bade.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;"that belongeth fairly to the chapel," quoth robin, "so lay it to one side.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;so this, also, was done according to robin's bidding, and the candles were laid to one side, along with honest quentin's unopened bales of silk.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;so the list was gone through with, and the goods adjudged according to what robin thought most fit.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;asked robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;"go, will scarlet," said robin, "thou art the strongest man here--bring a sword straightway, and cut this box open, if thou canst."

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;77;at this sight a murmur went all around among the band, like the sound of the wind in distant trees, but no man came forward nor touched the money.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;quoth robin, "thou, will scarlet, thou, allan a dale, and thou, little john, count it over."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;"my lord bishop," said robin hood, "i will not strip thee, as little john said, like a winter hedge, for thou shalt take back one third of thy money.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;then robin turned to sir richard of the lea, and quoth he, "now, sir richard, the church seemed like to despoil thee, therefore some of the overplus of church gains may well be used in aiding thee.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;sir richard looked at robin until something arose in his eyes that made all the lights and the faces blur together.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;77;quoth robin, "i do not understand those fine scruples that weigh with those of thy kind, but, nevertheless, it shall all be as thou dost wish.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;then robin hood and all his merry men arose, and robin said, "we cannot let thee go hence unattended, sir richard."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;"thou hast spoken well, little john, and it shall be done," said robin.

golden chain;Laburnum anagyroides;organism;PG10148;78;then up spake will scarlet, "let us give him a golden chain to hang about his neck, such as befits one of his blood, and also golden spurs to wear at his heels."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;then robin hood said, "thou hast spoken well, will scarlet, and it shall be done."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;then up spake will stutely, "let us give him yon bale of rich velvet and yon roll of cloth of gold to take home to his noble lady wife as a present from robin hood and his merry men all."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;at this all clapped their hands for joy, and robin said,"thou hast well spoken, will stutely, and it shall be done."

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;78;then robin came and threw a chain of gold about sir richard's neck, and will scarlet knelt and buckled the golden spurs upon his heel, and now little john led forward sir richard's horse, and the knight mounted.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;he looked down at robin for a little time, then of a sudden stooped and kissed his cheek.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;but robin laid his hand upon the bishop's arm and stayed him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;so the bishop and his train abided with robin for three days, and much sport his lordship had in that time, so that, as robin had said, when the time had come for him to go he was sorry to leave the greenwood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;at the end of three days robin set him free, and sent him forth from the forest with a guard of yeomen to keep freebooters from taking what was left of the packs and bundles.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;78;but, as the bishop rode away, he vowed within himself that he would sometime make robin rue the day that he stopped him in sherwood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;85;then one of the men brought the knight a strongbox, which he opened and took from it a bag and counted out five hundred pounds, the sum he had gotten from robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;85;"sir richard," quoth robin, "thou wilt pleasure us all if thou wilt keep that money as a gift from us of sherwood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;85;then robin hood said no more but gave the money to little john to put away in the treasury, for he had shrewdness enough to know that nought breeds ill will and heart bitterness like gifts forced upon one that cannot choose but take them.

yew;Taxus;organism;PG10148;85;then sir richard had the packs laid upon the ground and opened, whereupon a great shout went up that made the forest ring again, for lo, there were tenscore bows of finest spanish yew, all burnished till they shone again, and each bow inlaid with fanciful figures in silver, yet not inlaid so as to mar their strength.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;85;sir richard gave to each yeoman a bow and a quiver of arrows, but to robin he gave a stout bow inlaid with the cunningest workmanship in gold, while each arrow in his quiver was innocked with gold.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;85;at last the time came when sir richard must go, whereupon robin hood called his band around him, and each man of the yeomen took a torch in his hand to light the way through the woodlands.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;86;so they came to the edge of sherwood, and there the knight kissed robin upon the cheeks and left him and was gone.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;86;thus robin hood helped a noble knight out of his dire misfortunes, that else would have smothered the happiness from his life.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;86;" in the blossoming hedge the robin cock sings, for the sun it is merry and bright, and he joyfully hops and he flutters his wings, for his heart is all full of delight.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;86;"and such is the life of the strolling friar, with aplenty to eat and to drink, for the goodwife will keep him a seat by the fire, and the pretty girls smile at his wink.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;86;thus friar tuck sang in a rich and mellow voice, rolling his head from side to side in time with the music, and when he had done, all clapped their hands and shouted with laughter, for the song fitted him well.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;86;"in very sooth," quoth little john, "it is a goodly song, and, were i not a yeoman of sherwood forest, i had rather be a strolling friar than aught else in the world."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;86;"yea, it is a goodly song," said robin hood, "but methought those two burly beggars told the merrier tales and led the merrier life.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;87;thereupon little john and friar tuck went to the storehouse of the band, and there chose for the yeoman the robe of a gray friar.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;87;then they came forth again, and a mighty roar of laughter went up, for not only had the band never seen little john in such guise before, but the robe was too short for him by a good palm's-breadth.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;87;then up rose robin and took his stout staff in his hand, likewise, and slipped ten golden angels into his pouch, for no beggar's garb was among the stores of the band, so he was fain to run his chance of meeting a beggar and buying his clothes of him.

sparrow;Passer;organism;PG10148;88;in front of the door a clucking hen was scratching in the dust with a brood of chickens about her heels, the sparrows were chattering of household affairs under the eaves, and all was so sweet and peaceful that little john's heart laughed within him.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;90;at this the tinker and the peddler and the beggar nudged one another, and all grinned, and the friars scowled blackly at little john, but they could think of nothing further to say, so they turned to their horses.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;90;they were so proud that it made them feel sick with shame to think of riding along the highroad with a strolling friar, in robes all too short for him, running beside them, but yet they could not make little john stay against his will, for they knew he could crack the bones of both of them in a twinkling were he so minded.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;92;after he had so besought the saint for a time, he bade the friars feel in their pouches and see if the saint had sent them anything, so each put his hand slowly in the pouch that hung beside him, but brought nothing thence.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;95;"yea, truly," quoth robin, "help thyself, sweet chuck, and meantime let me see whether thy pigeon pie is fresh or no."

pigeon;Columba;organism;PG10148;95;so the one seized upon the ale and the other upon the pigeon pie, and nothing was heard for a while but the munching of food and the gurgle of ale as it left the skin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;95;at last, after a long time had passed thus, robin pushed the food from him and heaved a great sigh of deep content, for he felt as though he had been made all over anew.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;95;"nay," quoth robin, laughing.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10148;95;"mayhap that may be so," quoth robin, "for i bring to mind that gaffer swanthold sayeth jack shoemaker maketh ill bread, tom baker maketh ill shoon.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;95;"nevertheless," quoth robin, "i would have a try at it, and methinks i shall change clothes with thee, for thy garb seemeth to be pretty, not to say gay.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;95;to this the beggar listened with his knuckles resting against his hips, and when robin had ended he cocked his head on one side and thrust his tongue into his cheek.

hazel;Corylus;organism;PG10148;95;my name is riccon hazel, and i come from holywell, in flintshire, over by the river dee.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;95;"now, fellow," said robin, "it would ill suit me to spoil thy pretty head for thee, but i tell thee plainly, that but for this feast i would do that to thee would stop thy traveling the country for many a day to come.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;95;"take up thy club and defend thyself, fellow, for i will not only beat thee but i will take from thee thy money and leave thee not so much as a clipped groat to buy thyself a lump of goose grease to rub thy cracked crown withal.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;95;then up leaped merry robin and snatched up his staff also.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;then the beggar swung his staff also, and struck a mighty blow at robin, which the yeoman turned.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;three blows the beggar struck, yet never one touched so much as a hair of robin's head.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;96;then stout robin saw his chance, and, ere you could count three, riccon's staff was over the hedge, and riccon himself lay upon the green grass with no more motion than you could find in an empty pudding bag.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;quoth merry robin, laughing.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;then robin, seeing his plight, and that he was stunned with the blow, ran, still laughing, and brought the skin of ale and poured some of it on the beggar's head and some down his throat, so that presently he opened his eyes and looked around as though wondering why he lay upon his back.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;then robin, seeing that he had somewhat gathered the wits that had just been rapped out of his head, said, "now, good fellow, wilt thou change clothes with me, or shall i have to tap thee again?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;"i promise on the word of a true yeoman," quoth robin, thinking that the fellow had a few pennies that he would save.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;thereupon the beggar drew a little knife that hung at his side and, ripping up the lining of his coat, drew thence ten bright golden pounds, which he laid upon the ground beside him with a cunning wink at robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;"marry," quoth robin, laughing, "thou art a sly fellow, and i tell thee truly, had i known thou hadst so much money by thee maybe thou mightst not have carried it away, for i warrant thou didst not come honestly by it."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;then each stripped off his clothes and put on those of the other, and as lusty a beggar was robin hood as e'er you could find of a summer's day.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;96;quoth he, "i am a gay-feathered bird now.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;so he turned and left robin and, crossing the stile, was gone, but robin heard him singing from beyond the hedge as he strode away,

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;robin listened till the song ended in the distance, then he also crossed the stile into the road, but turned his toes away from where the beggar had gone.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;96;the road led up a gentle hill and up the hill robin walked, a half score or more of bags dangling about his legs.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;so robin, with all the empty road to himself, strode along whistling merrily, his bags and pouches bobbing and dangling at his thighs.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;97;at last he came to where a little grass-grown path left the road and, passing through a stile and down a hill, led into a little dell and on across a rill in the valley and up the hill on the other side, till it reached a windmill that stood on the cap of the rise where the wind bent the trees in swaying motion.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;robin looked at the spot and liked it, and, for no reason but that his fancy led him, he took the little path and walked down the grassy sunny slope of the open meadow, and so came to the little dingle and, ere he knew it, upon four lusty fellows that sat with legs outstretched around a goodly feast spread upon the ground.

fly;Diptera;organism;PG10148;97;but although all these troubles written upon the boards seemed so grievous, the four stout fellows sat around feasting as merrily as though cain's wife had never opened the pottle that held misfortunes and let them forth like a cloud of flies to pester us.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;the deaf man was the first to hear robin, for he said, "hark, brothers, i hear someone coming."

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;97;at this, the lame man, who had taken off his wooden leg and unstrapped his own leg, and was sitting with it stretched out upon the grass so as to rest it, made room for robin among them.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;"marry," quoth robin, laughing, and weighing the flask in his hands ere he drank, "methinks it is no more than seemly of you all to be glad to see me, seeing that i bring sight to the blind, speech to the dumb, hearing to the deaf, and such a lusty leg to a lame man.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;at this all grinned, and the blind beggar, who was the chief man among them, and was the broadest shouldered and most lusty rascal of all, smote robin upon the shoulder, swearing he was a right merry wag.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;"why," quoth robin, "i came this morning from sleeping overnight in sherwood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;if robin hood caught one of our trade in his woodlands he would, methinks, clip his ears."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;"methinks he would, too," quoth robin, laughing.

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10148;97;"stay, brother hodge," quoth the blind man, breaking into the talk, "i would not doubt our brother here, but bear in mind we know him not.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;97;at these words robin looked from one man to the other with mouth agape.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;98;"now out upon it," quoth robin hood testily, "an ye make sport of me by pattering such gibberish, it will be ill for you all, i tell you.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;98;but all the four beggars leaped to their feet when robin had done speaking, and the blind man snatched up a heavy knotted cudgel that lay beside him on the grass, as did the others likewise.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;98;but robin was ready for any happening.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10148;98;to this speech the beggars answered never a word, but they looked at robin as great blunderbore looked upon stout jack the slayer of giants, as though they would fain eat him, body and bones, nevertheless, they did not care to come nigher to him and his terrible staff.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;98;then, seeing them so hesitate, robin of a sudden leaped upon them, striking even as he leaped.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;98;robin looked after them, laughing, and thought that never had he seen so fleet a runner as the lame man, but neither of the beggars stopped nor turned around, for each felt in his mind the wind of robin's cudgel about his ears.

corn;Zea mays;organism;PG10148;99;but although robin laughed at the droll sight, he knew the wayfarer to be a certain rich corn engrosser of worksop, who more than once had bought all the grain in the countryside and held it till it reached even famine prices, thus making much money from the needs of poor people, and for this he was hated far and near by everyone that knew aught of him.

corn;Zea mays;organism;PG10148;101;the name of corn engrosser leaves a nasty taste upon the tongue of all honest men.

dragonfly;Anisoptera;organism;PG10148;101;all across the meadow lands the hot air danced and quivered, and in the limpid waters of the lowland brook, spanned by a little stone bridge, the fish hung motionless above the yellow gravel, and the dragonfly sat quite still, perched upon the sharp tip of a spike of the rushes, with its wings glistening in the sun.

barb;Laubuca;organism;PG10148;101;along the road a youth came riding upon a fair milk-white barb, and the folk that he passed stopped and turned and looked after him, for never had so lovely a lad or one so gaily clad been seen in nottingham before.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;102;thus came the queen's page, young richard partington, from famous london town down into nottinghamshire, upon her majesty's bidding, to seek robin hood in sherwood forest.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;102;the road was hot and dusty and his journey had been long, for that day he had come all the way from leicester town, a good twenty miles and more, wherefore young partington was right glad when he saw before him a sweet little inn, all shady and cool beneath the trees, in front of the door of which a sign hung pendant, bearing the picture of a blue boar.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;102;the landlord came and brought a pottle of wine and a long narrow glass upon a salver, which he held up to the page as he sat upon his horse.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;102;young partington poured forth the bright yellow wine and holding the glass aloft, cried, "here is to the health and long happiness of my royal mistress, the noble queen eleanor, and may my journey and her desirings soon have end, and i find a certain stout yeoman men call robin hood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;102;then one of the two, whom partington thought to be the tallest and stoutest fellow he had ever beheld, spoke up and said, "what seekest thou of robin hood, sir page?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;102;methinks i and my friend here might safely guide thee to robin hood, for we know where he may be found.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;102;thereupon both arose, and the tall yeoman said, "we think thou art true, sir page, and meanest no harm, therefore we will guide thee to robin hood as thou dost wish."

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;102;under the greenwood tree, in the cool shade that spread all around upon the sward, with flickering lights here and there, robin hood and many of his band lay upon the soft green grass, while allan a dale sang and played upon his sweetly sounding harp.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;102;all listened in silence, for young allan's singing was one of the greatest joys in all the world to them, but as they so listened there came of a sudden the sound of a horse's feet, and presently little john and will stutely came forth from the forest path into the open glade, young richard partington riding between them upon his milk-white horse.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;102;the three came toward where robin hood sat, all the band staring with might and main, for never had they seen so gay a sight as this young page, nor one so richly clad in silks and velvets and gold and jewels.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;102;cried robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;103;then young partington said, "if i err not, thou art the famous robin hood, and these thy stout band of outlawed yeomen.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;103;then robin hood bowed his head and taking the ring, kissed it right loyally, and then slipped it upon his little finger.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;103;"truly, thou art right," quoth robin, "and we have but short time to stay, therefore i will get me ready presently.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;103;then little john and will scarlet and allan a dale ran leaping, full of joy, to make themselves ready, while robin also prepared himself for the journey.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;103;after a while they all four came forth, and a right fair sight they made, for robin was clad in blue from head to foot, and little john and will scarlet in good lincoln green, and as for allan a dale, he was dressed in scarlet from the crown of his head to the toes of his pointed shoes.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;103;this place they left not long after the middle of the night, and traveling fast through the tender dawning of the summer day, when the dews lay shining on the meadows and faint mists hung in the dales, when the birds sang their sweetest and the cobwebs beneath the hedges glimmered like fairy cloth of silver, they came at last to the towers and walls of famous london town, while the morn was still young and all golden toward the east.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;103;thus robin hood and little john and will scarlet and allan a dale came before the queen into her own royal bower.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;103;then robin kneeled before the queen with his hands folded upon his breast, saying in simple phrase, "here am i, robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;104;at this, the queen and the ladies about her laughed again and again, for they pictured to themselves the stout bishop abiding in the forest and ranging the woods in lusty sport with robin and his band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;107;said robin hood hastily, in a low voice, but good queen eleanor laughed aloud, and a ripple of merriment sounded all over the booth.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;107;"your majesty," quoth he, "yon fellow in blue is a certain outlawed thief of the mid-country, named robin hood, yon tall, strapping villain goeth by the name of little john, the other fellow in green is a certain backsliding gentleman, known as will scarlet, the man in red is a rogue of a northern minstrel, named allan a dale."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;107;"yea," said the queen, smiling, "the bishop hath told the truth, and truly he should know them well, for he and two of his friars spent three days in merry sport with robin hood in sherwood forest.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;108;but when the king's archers went to their tents, they told their friends all that had passed, and how that these four men were the famous robin hood and three of his band, to wit, little john, will scarlet, and allan a dale.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;108;then robin hood and gilbert of the white hand tossed a farthing aloft to see who should lead in the shooting, and the lot fell to gilbert's side, thereupon he called upon hubert of suffolk to lead.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;108;merry robin laughed, and quoth he, "thou wilt have an ill time bettering that round, will, for it is thy turn next.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;108;at this robin bit his lips.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;108;but queen eleanor smiled, for she looked for better things from robin hood and little john.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;108;quoth robin hood, "that is the sweetest shot that hath been sped this day, but, nevertheless, friend tepus, thy cake is burned, methinks.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;108;quoth robin hood, smiting him upon the shoulder.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;109;having gotten three shafts to his liking, merry robin looked carefully to his bowstring ere he shot.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;109;and now a low murmur ran all among that great crowd, for never before had london seen such shooting as this, and never again would it see it after robin hood's day had gone.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;109;then sir hugh, seeing how wroth the king was, said never a word, but went straightway to do his bidding, so he came to where robin hood and the other stood, and told them what the king had said.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;109;"with all my heart," quoth merry robin, "i will shoot from this time till tomorrow day if it can pleasure my most gracious lord and king.

barley;Hordeum;organism;PG10148;109;so gilbert took his place once more, but this time he failed, for, a sudden little wind arising, his shaft missed the center ring, but by not more than the breadth of a barley straw.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;109;"thy eggs are cracked, gilbert," quoth robin, laughing, and straightway he loosed a shaft, and once more smote the white circle of the center.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;109;after the king had gone, all the yeomen of the archer guard came crowding around robin, and little john, and will, and allan, to snatch a look at these famous fellows from the mid-country, and with them came many that had been onlookers at the sport, for the same purpose.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;109;after a while the three judges that had the giving away of the prizes came forward, and the chief of them all spake to robin and said,

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;109;"according to agreement, the first prize belongeth rightly to thee, so here i give thee the silver bugle, here the quiver of ten golden arrows, and here a purse of twoscore and ten golden pounds."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;110;and as he spake he handed those things to robin, and then turned to little john.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;110;then up spake robin, and quoth he, "this silver bugle i keep in honor of this shooting match, but thou, gilbert, art the best archer of all the king's guard, and to thee i freely give this purse of gold.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;110;then up spake robin, and quoth he, "this silver bugle i keep in honor of this shooting match, but thou, gilbert, art the best archer of all the king's guard, and to thee i freely give this purse of gold.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;110;at this all shouted aloud, for it pleased them to hear robin speak so of them.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;110;at this another great shout went up, and many tossed their caps aloft, and swore among themselves that no better fellows ever walked the sod than robin hood and his stout yeomen.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;110;while they so shouted with loud voices, a tall burly yeoman of the king's guard came forward and plucked robin by the sleeve.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;110;quoth robin, starting, for he knew right well that it was the queen sent the message, and that she spake of the king's wrath.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;110;the chase of robin hood so robin hood and the others left the archery range at finsbury fields, and, tarrying not, set forth straightway upon their homeward journey.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;110;it was well for them that they did so, for they had not gone more than three or four miles upon their way when six of the yeomen of the king's guard came bustling among the crowd that still lingered, seeking for robin and his men, to seize upon them and make them prisoners.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;111;"forgive my boldness, your majesty, and believe that i have nought but the good of england and your majesty's desirings at heart, but what would it boot though my gracious lord did root up every tree of sherwood?

daisy;Bellis;organism;PG10148;111;moreover, i would say unto myself, a woman knoweth nought of the great things appertaining to state government, and, likewise, i know a woman is ever prone to take up a fancy, even as she would pluck a daisy from the roadside, and then throw it away when the savor is gone, therefore, though she hath taken a fancy to this outlaw, it will soon wane away and be forgotten.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;111;so the bishop talked, and the king lent his ear to his evil counsel, until, after a while, he turned to sir robert lee and bade him send six of the yeomen of the guard to take robin hood and his three men prisoners.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;111;now sir robert lee was a gentle and noble knight, and he felt grieved to the heart to see the king so break his promise, nevertheless, he said nothing, for he saw how bitterly the king was set against robin hood, but he did not send the yeomen of the guard at once, but went first to the queen, and told her all that had passed, and bade her send word to robin of his danger.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;111;this he did not for the well-being of robin hood, but because he would save his lord's honor if he could.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;111;thus it came about that when, after a while, the yeomen of the guard went to the archery field, they found not robin and the others, and so got no cakes at that fair.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;111;the afternoon was already well-nigh gone when robin hood, little john, will, and allan set forth upon their homeward way, trudging along merrily through the yellow slanting light, which speedily changed to rosy red as the sun sank low in the heavens.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;112;"now, richard partington," quoth robin, "this is the second time that thou hast saved my life, and if the proper time ever cometh i will show thee that robin hood never forgets these things.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;112;so each shook the other's hand, and the lad, turning his horse's head, rode back toward london, while robin entered the inn once more.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;quoth robin, "this is no place for us, for those are after us with whom we will stand but an ill chance an we fall into their hands.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;when they had come to the highroad without the town, robin stopped and told them all that had passed between young partington and himself, and how that the king's men were after them with hot heels.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;"so, be ye wily," said robin hood, "and keep well away from the northward roads till ye have gotten well to the eastward.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;then robin kissed the three upon the cheeks, and they kissed him, and so they parted company.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;113;here they leaped from their horses and quickly surrounded the place, the leader of the band and four others entering the room where the yeomen had been.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;113;but they found that their birds had flown again, and that the king had been balked a second time.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;113;for this news the leader of the band thanked mine host right heartily, and, calling his men together, mounted and set forth again, galloping forward to saint albans upon a wild goose chase.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;eight days they journeyed thus ere they reached the woodlands in safety, but when they got to the greenwood glade, they found that robin had not yet returned.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;for robin was not as lucky in getting back as his men had been, as you shall presently hear.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;and now robin's heart began to laugh aloud, for he thought that his danger had gone by, and that his nostrils would soon snuff the spicy air of the woodlands once again.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;but there is many a slip betwixt the cup and the lip, and this robin was to find.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;for thus it was,when the king's men found themselves foiled at saint albans, and that robin and his men were not to be found high nor low, they knew not what to do.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;when he heard that robin hood had once more slipped out of the trap, he stayed not a minute, but, gathering his bands together, he pushed forward to the northward with speed, leaving orders for all the troops that came to saint albans to follow after him without tarrying.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;113;the sheriff of nottingham called forth all his men likewise, and joined with the bishop, for he saw that this was the best chance that had ever befallen of paying back his score in full to robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;114;but of all this robin knew not a whit, so he whistled merrily as he trudged along the road beyond stanton, with his heart as free from care as the yolk of an egg is from cobwebs.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;114;here robin stopped, being athirst, and, kneeling down, he made a cup of the palms of his hands, and began to drink.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;114;on either side of the road, for a long distance, stood tangled thickets of bushes and young trees, and it pleased robin's heart to hear the little birds singing therein, for it made him think of sherwood, and it seemed as though it had been a lifetime since he had breathed the air of the woodlands.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10148;114;on either side of the road, for a long distance, stood tangled thickets of bushes and young trees, and it pleased robin's heart to hear the little birds singing therein, for it made him think of sherwood, and it seemed as though it had been a lifetime since he had breathed the air of the woodlands.

goose;Anserinae;organism;PG10148;114;quick as a wink robin sprang to his feet, and, at one bound, crossed the stream and the roadside, and plunged headlong into the thicket, without looking around, for he knew right well that that which had hissed so venomously beside his ear was a gray goose shaft, and that to tarry so much as a moment meant death.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;114;they leaped from their horses and plunged straightway into the thicket after robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;114;but robin knew the ground better than they did, so crawling here, stooping there, and, anon, running across some little open, he soon left them far behind, coming out, at last, upon another road about eight hundred paces distant from the one he had left.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;114;but robin had not gone more than three furlongs in that direction when he came suddenly to the brow of a hill, and saw beneath him another band of the king's men seated in the shade along the roadside in the valley beneath.

deer;Cervidae;organism;PG10148;114;they raised a great shout when they saw him, such as the hunter gives when the deer breaks cover, but robin was then a quarter of a mile and more away from them, coursing over the ground like a greyhound.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;114;here, seeing that he was out of present danger, he slackened in his running, and at last sat him down beneath a hedge where the grass was the longest and the shade the coolest, there to rest and catch his wind.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;114;"by my soul, robin," quoth he to himself, "that was the narrowest miss that e'er thou hadst in all thy life.

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;114;it seemed as though saint dunstan was like to answer his prayer, for along the road came plodding a certain cobbler, one quince, of derby, who had been to take a pair of shoes to a farmer nigh kirk langly, and was now coming back home again, with a fair boiled capon in his pouch and a stout pottle of beer by his side, which same the farmer had given him for joy of such a stout pair of shoon.

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;114;good quince was an honest fellow, but his wits were somewhat of the heavy sort, like unbaked dough, so that the only thing that was in his mind was, "three shillings sixpence ha'penny for thy shoon, good quince--three shillings sixpence ha'penny for thy shoon," and this traveled round and round inside of his head, without another thought getting into his noddle, as a pea rolls round and round inside an empty quart pot.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;"halloa, good friend," quoth robin, from beneath the hedge, when the other had gotten nigh enough, "whither away so merrily this bright day?"

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;115;"marry," quoth merry robin, "i sit beneath the hedge here to drop salt on the tails of golden birds, but in sooth thou art the first chick of any worth i ha' seen this blessed day."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;"marry," quoth merry robin, "i sit beneath the hedge here to drop salt on the tails of golden birds, but in sooth thou art the first chick of any worth i ha' seen this blessed day."

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;115;i ha' never seen those same golden birds.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;"ay, truly," quoth robin, "they are as thick here as fresh herring in cannock chase."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;"yea," quoth robin, "but this salt is of an odd kind, let me tell thee, for it can only be gotten by boiling down a quart of moonbeams in a wooden platter, and then one hath but a pinch.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;115;at these words the cobbler looked down at those things of which merry robin spoke, for the thoughts of the golden bird had driven them from his mind, and it took him some time to scrape the memory of them back again.

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;115;truly, quince the cobbler will ha' a fine feast this day an i mistake not."

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;115;"but tell me, good quince," said robin, "hast thou a mind to sell those things to me?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;"but tell me, good quince," said robin, "hast thou a mind to sell those things to me?

bully;Sideroxylon;organism;PG10148;115;what sayst thou, bully boy?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;"never a jest do i speak," quoth robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;at these words he began slipping off his doublet, and the cobbler, seeing him so in earnest, began pulling off his clothes also, for robin hood's garb tickled his eye.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;so each put on the other fellow's clothes, and robin gave the honest cobbler ten bright new shillings.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;quoth merry robin, "i ha' been a many things in my life before, but never have i been an honest cobbler.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;115;then robin stretched his legs out with a sweet feeling of comfort within him.

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;115;quoth he, "by the turn of thy voice, good quince, i know that thou hast a fair song or two running loose in thy head like colts in a meadow.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10148;116;we know thee, thou old fox.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;116;robin also gaped and stared in a wondering way, just as the cobbler would have done in his place.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;116;quoth one of the men "why, i tell thee that this is that same rogue that men call robin hood."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;116;moreover, as he looked at robin hood, and saw the yeoman look so like what he knew himself to be, he began to doubt and to think that mayhap he was the great outlaw in real sooth.

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;116;now i had thought--but nay, quince, thou art mistook--yet--am i?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;116;nay, i must indeed be robin hood!

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;116;quoth robin hood, "look ye there, now!

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;116;i, myself, am quince, the cobbler of derby town."

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;116;said quince.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;116;"then, indeed, i am somebody else, and can be none other than robin hood.

quince;Cydonia oblonga;organism;PG10148;116;robin stood looking after them, and when they were gone he laughed till the tears rolled down his cheeks, for he knew that no harm would befall the honest fellow, and he pictured to himself the bishop's face when good quince was brought before him as robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;116;but robin hood had gone through more than he wotted of.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;117;there were but three bedrooms in the place, and to the meanest of these the landlord showed robin hood, but little robin cared for the looks of the place, for he could have slept that night upon a bed of broken stones.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;117;not long after robin had so gone to his rest a great cloud peeped blackly over the hills to the westward.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;117;as though the wind had brought a guest along with it, the door opened of a sudden and in came a friar of emmet priory, and one in high degree, as was shown by the softness and sleekness of his robes and the richness of his rosary.

mule;Equus mulus;organism;PG10148;117;he called to the landlord, and bade him first have his mule well fed and bedded in the stable, and then to bring him the very best there was in the house.

mouse;Mus;organism;PG10148;117;so presently a savory stew of tripe and onions, with sweet little fat dumplings, was set before him, likewise a good stout pottle of malmsey, and straightway the holy friar fell to with great courage and heartiness, so that in a short time nought was left but a little pool of gravy in the center of the platter, not large enow to keep the life in a starving mouse.

onion;Allium cepa;organism;PG10148;117;so presently a savory stew of tripe and onions, with sweet little fat dumplings, was set before him, likewise a good stout pottle of malmsey, and straightway the holy friar fell to with great courage and heartiness, so that in a short time nought was left but a little pool of gravy in the center of the platter, not large enow to keep the life in a starving mouse.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;117;at last the holy friar bade the landlord show him to his room, but when he heard that he was to bed with a cobbler, he was as ill contented a fellow as you could find in all england, nevertheless there was nothing for it, and he must sleep there or nowhere, so, taking up his candle, he went off, grumbling like the now distant thunder.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;117;when he came to the room where he was to sleep he held the light over robin and looked at him from top to toe, then he felt better pleased, for, instead, of a rough, dirty-bearded fellow, he beheld as fresh and clean a lad as one could find in a week of sundays, so, slipping off his clothes, he also huddled into the bed, where robin, grunting and grumbling in his sleep, made room for him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;117;robin was more sound asleep, i wot, than he had been for many a day, else he would never have rested so quietly with one of the friar's sort so close beside him.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;117;robin was more sound asleep, i wot, than he had been for many a day, else he would never have rested so quietly with one of the friar's sort so close beside him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;117;as for the friar, had he known who robin hood was, you may well believe he would almost as soon have slept with an adder as with the man he had for a bedfellow.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;117;so the night passed comfortably enough, but at the first dawn of day robin opened his eyes and turned his head upon the pillow.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;117;"now," quoth robin to himself, "i wonder how this thing hath dropped into my bed during the night."

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;118;so saying, he arose softly, so as not to waken the other, and looking about the room he espied the friar's clothes lying upon a bench near the wall.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;118;first he looked at the clothes, with his head on one side, and then he looked at the friar and slowly winked one eye.

mouse;Mus;organism;PG10148;118;then he went forth into the freshness of the morning, and the stableman that was up and about the stables opened his eyes as though he saw a green mouse before him, for such men as the friars of emmet were not wont to be early risers, but the man bottled his thoughts, and only asked robin whether he wanted his mule brought from the stable.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;118;as for the holy friar, when he arose he was in as pretty a stew as any man in all the world, for his rich, soft robes were gone, likewise his purse with ten golden pounds in it, and nought was left but patched clothes and a leathern apron.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;118;in vain he swore he was a holy man, and showed his shaven crown, off he must go, for nothing would do but that he was robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;118;meanwhile merry robin rode along contentedly, passing safely by two bands of the king's men, until his heart began to dance within him because of the nearness of sherwood, so he traveled ever on to the eastward, till, of a sudden, he met a noble knight in a shady lane.

mule;Equus mulus;organism;PG10148;118;then robin checked his mule quickly and leaped from off its back.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;118;then robin checked his mule quickly and leaped from off its back.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;118;but when robin had done, sir richard shook his head sadly.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;118;"thou art in greater danger now, robin, than thou hast yet been," said he, "for before thee lie bands of the sheriff's men blocking every road and letting none pass through the lines without examining them closely.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10148;118;having so spoken, sir richard bent his head in thought, and robin felt his heart sink within him like that of the fox that hears the hounds at his heels and finds his den blocked with earth so that there is no hiding for him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;118;having so spoken, sir richard bent his head in thought, and robin felt his heart sink within him like that of the fox that hears the hounds at his heels and finds his den blocked with earth so that there is no hiding for him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;118;but presently sir richard spoke again, saying, "one thing thou canst do, robin, and one only.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;118;so robin went with sir richard of the lea, and did as he said, for he saw the wisdom of that which the knight advised, and that this was his only chance of safety.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10148;119;queen eleanor walked in her royal garden, amid the roses that bloomed sweetly, and with her walked six of her ladies-in-waiting, chattering blithely together.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;119;of a sudden a man leaped up to the top of the wall from the other side, and then, hanging for a moment, dropped lightly upon the grass within.

grass;Poaceae;organism;PG10148;119;of a sudden a man leaped up to the top of the wall from the other side, and then, hanging for a moment, dropped lightly upon the grass within.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;all the ladies-in-waiting shrieked at the suddenness of his coming, but the man ran to the queen and kneeled at her feet, and she saw that it was robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;"why, how now, robin!"

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10148;119;cried she, "dost thou dare to come into the very jaws of the raging lion?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;"yea," quoth robin, "i do know right well that the king seeks me, and therefore i have come, for, surely, no ill can befall me when he hath pledged his royal word to your majesty for my safety.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;"i take thy meaning, robin hood," said the queen, "and that thou dost convey reproach to me, as well thou mayst, for i know that i have not done by thee as i ought to have done.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10148;119;so saying, she left robin in the garden of roses, and was gone a long time.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;so saying, she left robin in the garden of roses, and was gone a long time.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;then sir robert came straight forward to where robin hood stood, and he spoke to the yeoman in a cold, stern voice.

lion;Panthera leo;organism;PG10148;119;thou hast put thy head in the angry lion's mouth, and yet thou hast escaped by a miracle.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;so saying, he turned and left robin and was gone.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;for three days robin abided in london in the queen's household, and at the end of that time the king's head page, edward cunningham, came, and taking robin with him, departed northward upon his way to sherwood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;robin hood and guy of gisbourne a long time passed after the great shooting match, and during that time robin followed one part of the advice of sir robert lee, to wit, that of being less bold in his comings and his goings, for though mayhap he may not have been more honest,as most folks regard honesty,, he took good care not to travel so far from sherwood that he could not reach it both easily and quickly.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;great changes had fallen in this time, for king henry had died and king richard had come to the crown that fitted him so well through many hard trials, and through adventures as stirring as any that ever befell robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;but though great changes came, they did not reach to sherwood's shades, for there robin hood and his men dwelled as merrily as they had ever done, with hunting and feasting and singing and blithe woodland sports, for it was little the outside striving of the world troubled them.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;119;the dawning of a summer's day was fresh and bright, and the birds sang sweetly in a great tumult of sound.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;119;so loud was their singing that it awakened robin hood where he lay sleeping, so that he stirred, and turned, and arose.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;120;robin hood and little john walked down a forest path where all around the leaves danced and twinkled as the breeze trembled through them and the sunlight came flickering down.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;120;quoth robin hood, "i make my vow, little john, my blood tickles my veins as it flows through them this gay morn.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;120;"i like thy plan," quoth robin, "therefore we will part here.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;120;at this robin hood laughed.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;120;so saying, he clapped his palm to little john's and each departed upon his way, the trees quickly shutting the one from the other's sight.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;128;roared he, and without another word he wheeled his horse in the road and went off in a cloud of dust.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;128;the sheriff's men, seeing their master thus fleeing for his life, thought that it was not their business to tarry longer, so, clapping spurs to their horses, they also dashed away after him.

sparrow;Passer;organism;PG10148;128;little john twanged his bowstring with a shout, and when the sheriff dashed in through the gates of nottingham town at full speed, a gray goose shaft stuck out behind him like a moulting sparrow with one feather in its tail.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;128;thus the sheriff and a score of men ran away from robin hood and little john, so that when will stutely and a dozen or more of stout yeomen burst from out the covert, they saw nought of their master's enemies, for the sheriff and his men were scurrying away in the distance, hidden within a cloud of dust like a little thunderstorm.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;128;but it would not do for them to roam the forest at large any more, so they promised that, after they had gone and told their mother of their escape, they would come that night to the greenwood tree, and thenceforth become men of the band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;129;to this the sheriff answered never a word, but all the blood left his cheeks, and he caught at the pommel of his saddle to keep himself from falling, for he also saw the fellow that so shouted, and knew him to be friar tuck, and, moreover, behind friar tuck he saw the faces of robin hood and little john and will scarlet and will stutely and allan a dale and others of the band.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;129;thus he spake, for he was ashamed that the king should know that robin hood feared him so little that he thus dared to come within the very gates of nottingham town.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;129;thus rode the king into nottingham town on that bright afternoon in the early fall season, and none rejoiced more than robin hood and his merry men to see him come so royally unto his own.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;129;quoth the king to the sheriff, laughing as he spoke, "i have heard much spoken concerning the doings of certain fellows hereabouts, one robin hood and his band, who are outlaws and abide in sherwood forest.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;130;"may it please your majesty," said he, "when i was away in palestine i heard ofttimes from my father, and in most cases i heard of this very fellow, robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;130;then the king laughingly bade him tell his tale, whereupon he told how robin hood had aided sir richard of the lea with money that he had borrowed from the bishop of hereford.

cherry;Prunus;organism;PG10148;130;again and again the king and those present roared with laughter, while the poor bishop waxed cherry red in the face with vexation, for the matter was a sore thing with him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;130;when sir henry of the lea was done, others of those present, seeing how the king enjoyed this merry tale, told other tales concerning robin and his merry men.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;130;with him were young sir henry of the lea and two other knights and three barons of nottinghamshire, but the king's mind still dwelled upon robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;130;"now," quoth he, "i would freely give a hundred pounds to meet this roguish fellow, robin hood, and to see somewhat of his doings in sherwood forest."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;130;but how wilt thou cause me to meet robin hood?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;130;"why, thus," said sir hubert, "let your majesty and us here present put on the robes of seven of the order of black friars, and let your majesty hang a purse of one hundred pounds beneath your gown, then let us undertake to ride from here to mansfield town tomorrow, and, without i am much mistaken, we will both meet with robin hood and dine with him before the day be passed."

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;130;"why, thus," said sir hubert, "let your majesty and us here present put on the robes of seven of the order of black friars, and let your majesty hang a purse of one hundred pounds beneath your gown, then let us undertake to ride from here to mansfield town tomorrow, and, without i am much mistaken, we will both meet with robin hood and dine with him before the day be passed."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;130;"but did i not hear aright when i was told that this robin hood hath shed no blood since he was outlawed, saving only that of that vile guy of gisbourne, for whose death all honest men should thank him?"

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;131;"not a whit," quoth merry robin hood, for the fellow was he, "for in sooth all the holiness belonging to rich friars, such as ye are, one could drop into a thimble and the goodwife would never feel it with the tip of her finger.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;131;"it may not be," said robin, "for it would look but ill of us to let such holy men travel onward with empty stomachs.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;131;"hut, tut," quoth merry robin, "what proud words are these?

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;131;then robin bade him keep fifty pounds for themselves, and put fifty back into the purse.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;134;across the glade they came running, and, as they came, sir richard shouted to robin,"make haste, dear friend, gather thy band together and come with me!

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;134;yet, sooner would i face your majesty's wrath than suffer aught of harm that i could stay to fall upon robin hood and his band, for to them i owe life, honor, everything.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;134;ere the knight had done speaking, one of the mock friars that stood near the king came forward and knelt beside sir richard, and throwing back his cowl showed the face of young sir henry of the lea.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;134;then sir henry grasped his father's hand and said, "here kneels one who hath served thee well, king richard, and, as thou knowest, hath stepped between thee and death in palestine, yet do i abide by my dear father, and here i say also, that i would freely give shelter to this noble outlaw, robin hood, even though it brought thy wrath upon me, for my father's honor and my father's welfare are as dear to me as mine own."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;135;then all arose and the king beckoned robin hood to come to him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;135;"mine ears would be deafened in death ere they would cease to hear your majesty's voice," said robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;135;talk not lightly of thy sins, good robin.

deer;Cervidae;organism;PG10148;135;as for the rest of thy band, we will take their names and have them duly recorded as royal rangers, for methinks it were wiser to have them changed to law-abiding caretakers of our deer in sherwood than to leave them to run at large as outlawed slayers thereof.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;135;so robin bade his men make ready a grand feast.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;135;while this was going forward, the king bade robin call allan a dale, for he would hear him sing.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10148;136;but now one came forward and said that the feast was ready, so robin hood brought king richard and those with him to where it lay all spread out on fair white linen cloths which lay upon the soft green grass.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;that night he lay in sherwood forest upon a bed of sweet green leaves, and early the next morning he set forth from the woodlands for nottingham town, robin hood and all of his band going with him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;as for the sheriff, he knew not what to say nor where to look when he saw robin hood in such high favor with the king, while all his heart was filled with gall because of the vexation that lay upon him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;the next day the king took leave of nottingham town, so robin hood and little john and will scarlet and allan a dale shook hands with all the rest of the band, kissing the cheeks of each man, and swearing that they would often come to sherwood and see them.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;136;then each mounted his horse and rode away in the train of the king.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;epilogue thus end the merry adventures of robin hood, for, in spite of his promise, it was many a year ere he saw sherwood again.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;but robin hood and allan a dale did not come again to sherwood so quickly, for thus it was,robin, through his great fame as an archer, became a favorite with the king, so that he speedily rose in rank to be the chief of all the yeomen.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;at last the king, seeing how faithful and how loyal he was, created him earl of huntingdon, so robin followed the king to the wars, and found his time so full that he had no chance to come back to sherwood for even so much as a day.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;as for allan a dale and his wife, the fair ellen, they followed robin hood and shared in all his ups and downs of life.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;i will not dwell upon the matter overlong, but will tell as speedily as may be of how that stout fellow, robin hood, died as he had lived, not at court as earl of huntingdon, but with bow in hand, his heart in the greenwood, and he himself a right yeoman.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;king richard died upon the battlefield, in such a way as properly became a lion-hearted king, as you yourself, no doubt, know, so, after a time, the earl of huntingdon--or robin hood, as we still call him as of old-- finding nothing for his doing abroad, came back to merry england again.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;136;with him came allan a dale and his wife, the fair ellen, for these two had been chief of robin's household ever since he had left sherwood forest.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10148;137;the leaves were green and the small birds sang blithely, just as they used to do in fair sherwood when robin hood roamed the woodland shades with a free heart and a light heel.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;the leaves were green and the small birds sang blithely, just as they used to do in fair sherwood when robin hood roamed the woodland shades with a free heart and a light heel.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;all the sweetness of the time and the joyousness of everything brought back to robin's mind his forest life, so that a great longing came upon him to behold the woodlands once more.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;so robin hood and allan a dale set forth without delay to nottinghamshire and sherwood forest.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;the first night they took up their inn at nottingham town, yet they did not go to pay their duty to the sheriff, for his worship bore many a bitter grudge against robin hood, which grudges had not been lessened by robin's rise in the world.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;137;the next day at an early hour they mounted their horses and set forth for the woodlands.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;as they passed along the road it seemed to robin that he knew every stick and stone that his eyes looked upon.

bramble;Rubus plicatus;organism;PG10148;137;yonder was a path that he had ofttimes trod of a mellow evening, with little john beside him, here was one, now nigh choked with brambles, along which he and a little band had walked when they went forth to seek a certain curtal friar.

friar;Atherina;organism;PG10148;137;yonder was a path that he had ofttimes trod of a mellow evening, with little john beside him, here was one, now nigh choked with brambles, along which he and a little band had walked when they went forth to seek a certain curtal friar.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;137;thus at last they came to the open glade, and the broad, wide-spreading greenwood tree which was their home for so many years.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10148;137;neither of the two spoke when they stood beneath that tree.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;robin looked all about him at the well-known things, so like what they used to be and yet so different, for, where once was the bustle of many busy fellows was now the quietness of solitude, and, as he looked, the woodlands, the greensward, and the sky all blurred together in his sight through salt tears, for such a great yearning came upon him as he looked on these things,as well known to him as the fingers of his right hand,that he could not keep back the water from his eyes.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;137;that morning he had slung his good old bugle horn over his shoulder, and now, with the yearning, came a great longing to sound his bugle once more.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;137;now it chanced that on that very morn little john was walking through a spur of the forest upon certain matters of business, and as he paced along, sunk in meditation, the faint, clear notes of a distant bugle horn came to his ear.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;137;again came the bugle note, thin and clear, and yet again it sounded.

wild boar;Sus scrofa;organism;PG10148;137;onward he plunged, crackling and rending, as the wild boar rushes through the underbrush.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;137;little recked he of thorns and briers that scratched his flesh and tore his clothing, for all he thought of was to get, by the shortest way, to the greenwood glade whence he knew the sound of the bugle horn came.

brier;Erica arborea;organism;PG10148;137;little recked he of thorns and briers that scratched his flesh and tore his clothing, for all he thought of was to get, by the shortest way, to the greenwood glade whence he knew the sound of the bugle horn came.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;out he burst from the covert, at last, a shower of little broken twigs falling about him, and, without pausing a moment, rushed forward and flung himself at robin's feet.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;then he clasped his arms around the master's knees, and all his body was shaken with great sobs, neither could robin nor allan a dale speak, but stood looking down at little john, the tears rolling down their cheeks.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;while they thus stood, seven royal rangers rushed into the open glade and raised a great shout of joy at the sight of robin, and at their head was will stutely.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;then, after a while, came four more, panting with their running, and two of these four were will scathelock and midge, the miller, for all of these had heard the sound of robin hood's horn.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;all these ran to robin and kissed his hands and his clothing, with great sound of weeping.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;137;after a while robin looked around him with tear-dimmed eyes and said, in a husky voice, "now, i swear that never again will i leave these dear woodlands.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;now do i lay by the name of robert, earl of huntingdon, and take upon me once again that nobler title, robin hood, the yeoman."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;the news that robin hood had come back again to dwell in sherwood as of old spread like wildfire all over the countryside, so that ere a se'ennight had passed nearly all of his old yeomen had gathered about him again.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;but when the news of all this reached the ears of king john, he swore both loud and deep, and took a solemn vow that he would not rest until he had robin hood in his power, dead or alive.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;sir william dale was well acquainted with sherwood forest, for he was head keeper over that part of it that lay nigh to good mansfield town, so to him the king turned, and bade him take an army of men and go straightway to seek robin hood.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;likewise the king gave sir william his signet ring to show to the sheriff, that he might raise all his armed men to aid the others in their chase of robin.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;so sir william and the sheriff set forth to do the king's bidding and to search for robin hood, and for seven days they hunted up and down, yet found him not.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;now, had robin hood been as peaceful as of old, everything might have ended in smoke, as other such ventures had always done before, but he had fought for years under king richard, and was changed from what he used to be.

fox;Vulpes;organism;PG10148;138;it galled his pride to thus flee away before those sent against him, as a chased fox flees from the hounds, so thus it came about, at last, that robin hood and his yeomen met sir william and the sheriff and their men in the forest, and a bloody fight followed.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10148;138;the first man slain in that fight was the sheriff of nottingham, for he fell from his horse with an arrow in his brain ere half a score of shafts had been sped.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;but though robin hood had beaten off his enemies in fair fight, all this lay heavily upon his mind, so that he brooded over it until a fever seized upon him.

leech;Hirudinea;organism;PG10148;138;thus it came that, on the morning of the fourth day, he called little john to him, and told him that he could not shake the fever from him, and that he would go to his cousin, the prioress of the nunnery near kirklees, in yorkshire, who was a skillful leech, and he would have her open a vein in his arm and take a little blood from him, for the bettering of his health.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;so little john and he took their leave of the others, and robin hood bade will stutely be the captain of the band until they should come back.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;now robin had done much to aid this cousin of his, for it was through king richard's love of him that she had been made prioress of the place.

leech;Hirudinea;organism;PG10148;138;thus it happened that when robin came to her and told her how he wished her services as leech, she began plotting ill against him in her mind, thinking that by doing evil to him she might find favor with his enemies.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;138;nevertheless, she kept this well to herself and received robin with seeming kindness.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10148;138;but, though he did not come in, neither did he go far away, for he laid him down in a little glade near by, where he could watch the place that robin abided, like some great, faithful dog turned away from the door where his master has entered.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;139;after the women had gotten robin hood to the room beneath the eaves, the prioress sent all of the others away, then, taking a little cord, she tied it tightly about robin's arm, as though she were about to bleed him.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;139;of this robin knew not, for, though he saw the blood flow, it did not come fast enough to make him think that there was anything ill in it.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;139;all that livelong day the blood ran from robin hood's arm, nor could he check it, though he strove in every way to do so.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10148;139;then he arose, tottering, and bearing himself up by the palms of his hands against the wall, he reached his bugle horn at last.

palm;Arecaceae;organism;PG10148;139;then he arose, tottering, and bearing himself up by the palms of his hands against the wall, he reached his bugle horn at last.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10148;139;loudly he knocked at the door, and in a loud voice shouted for them to let him in, but the door was of massive oak, strongly barred, and studded with spikes, so they felt safe, and bade little john begone.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;139;then, with a great, wild cry of love and grief and pity, little john leaped forward and caught robin hood in his arms.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;139;but robin shook his head and smiled faintly where he lay.

crow;Euploea;organism;PG10148;139;at last he said, in a deep, husky voice, "now, if aught of harm befalls thee because of this day's doings, i swear by saint george that the red cock shall crow over the rooftree of this house, for the hot flames shall lick every crack and cranny thereof.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;140;but robin hood took little john's rough, brown fist in his white hands, and chid him softly in his low, weak voice, asking him since what time little john had thought of doing harm to women, even in vengeance.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;140;then a silence fell, and little john sat with robin hood's hand in his, gazing out of the open window, ever and anon swallowing a great lump that came in his throat.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;140;then robin hood, in a weak, faltering voice, bade little john raise him that he might look out once more upon the woodlands, so the yeoman lifted him in his arms, as he bade, and robin hood's head lay on his friend's shoulder.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;140;then, presently, robin hood bade him string his stout bow for him, and choose a smooth fair arrow from his quiver.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;140;robin hood's fingers wrapped lovingly around his good bow, and he smiled faintly when he felt it in his grasp, then he nocked the arrow on that part of the string that the tips of his fingers knew so well.

bear;Ursidae;organism;PG10148;140;bear my words well in mind, for i mean them."

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10148;140;thus died robin hood, at kirklees nunnery, in fair yorkshire, with mercy in his heart toward those that had been his undoing, for thus he showed mercy for the erring and pity for the weak through all the time of his living.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10149;60;come, ned, if you are sufficiently satisfied with looking at the wigwam in a bird's-eye view, we will descend and put its beauties to the severer test of a close examination."

diver;Gavia;organism;PG10149;60;it is true that mr. dodge, arrived at dodgeopolis, had dilated on the subject in his hebdomadal, with divers additions and conjectures of his own, and this, too, in a way to attract, a good deal of attention in the interior, but, it being a rule with those who are supposed to dwell at the fountain of foreign intelligence, not to receive any thing from those who ought not to be better informed than themselves, the effinghams and their friends had never heard of his account of the matter.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10149;63;"cousin jack--" interrupted the smiling paul.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10149;63;"cousin jack, then, if you dislike the formality i used, both my father and cousin jack examined the american navy registers for your name, without success, as i understood, and the inference that followed was fair enough, i believe you will admit."

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10149;64;they walked some distance in silence, until they reached the grounds of a house that was beautifully placed on the side of the mountain, near a lovely wood of pines.

rose;Rosa;organism;PG10149;70;then it had never struck any of the party before, that it was vulgar and aristocratic to pursue the sport among roses, and one or two of them actually complained that they had pricked their fingers, in searching for the ball.

potato;Solanum tuberosum;organism;PG10149;71;by the way, mr. effingham, he asked me to propose to let him take down your garden fence, in order that he may haul some manure on his potato patch, which wants it dreadfully, he says."

potato;Solanum tuberosum;organism;PG10149;71;as for aristabulus, who saw nothing out of rule, or contrary to his own notions of propriety, in what had passed, he hurried off to tell the barber, who was so ignorant of the first duty of his trade, that he was at liberty to pull down mr. effingham's fence, in order to manure his own potato patch.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10149;71;in short, the state of society is favourable to the claims of mere animal force, and unfavourable to those of the higher qualities.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10149;72;in some places, the pastoral age, or that of good fellowship, continues for a whole life, to the obvious retrogression of the people, in most of the higher qualities, but to their manifest advantage, however, in the pleasures of the time being, while, in others, it passes away rapidly, like the buoyant animal joys, that live their time, between fourteen and twenty.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10149;72;even when this is the case, there is commonly so large an infusion of the birds of passage, men who are adventurers in quest of advancement, and who live without the charities of a neighbourhood, as they may be said almost to live without a home, that there is to be found, for a long time, a middle state of society, during which it may well be questioned whether a community belongs to the second or to the third of the periods named.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10149;73;as opposed in feeling to these relics of the olden time, were the birds of passage so often named, a numerous and restless class, that, of themselves, are almost sufficient to destroy whatever there is of poetry, or of local attachment, in any region where they resort.

mitre;Mitrinae;organism;PG10149;86;to his church-and-state notions, and anti-catholic prejudices, which were quite as much political as religious, there was every thing that was proper, and nothing that was wrong, in rejecting a cross for a mitre.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;87;the boat now came under a shore where the trees fringed the very water, frequently overhanging the element that mirrored their fantastic forms.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;87;"this is the flag-ship," half whispered john effingham, as they came near the other skiff, "containing no less a man than the 'commodore.'

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;87;formerly, the chief of the lake was an admiral, but that was in times when, living nearer to the monarchy, we retained some of the european terms, now, no man rises higher than a commodore in america, whether it be on the ocean or on the otsego, whatever may be his merits or his services.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;87;a charming day, commodore, i rejoice to see you still afloat, in your glory."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;87;the commodore, a tail, thin, athletic man of seventy, with a white head, and movements that were quick as those of a boy, had not glanced aside at the approaching boat, until he was thus saluted in the well-known voice of john effingham.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;87;"how is it, commodore, that the water near the village is less limpid than common, and that even up here, we see so many specks floating on its surface?"

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;87;here the commodore turned entirely round, and raising an open hand in an oratorical manner, he added,--"you must know, ladies and gentlemen, that the lake is in blow."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;88;"all very natural, mr. john," returned the commodore, laughing, and again flourishing his hand in his own peculiar manner.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;89;i do not say this notion is true, or that it is my own, but we all know that natty did dislike to see a new settler arrive in the mountains, and that he loved a tree as a muskrat loves water.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;89;the skiff of the party continued to pull slowly along the fringed shore, occasionally sheering more into the lake, to avoid some overhanging and nearly horizontal tree, and then returning so closely to the land, as barely to clear the pebbles of the narrow strand with the oar.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10149;89;more than half of the forest of tall, solemn pines, that had veiled the earth when the country was first settled, had already disappeared, but, agreeably to one of the mysterious laws by which nature is governed, a rich second growth, that included nearly every variety of american wood, had shot up in their places.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10149;89;the gentlemen pulled the light skiff fully a mile under this overhanging foliage, occasionally frightening some migratory bird from a branch, or a water-fowl from the narrow strand.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10149;89;at length, john effingham desired them to cease rowing, and managing the skiff for a minute or two with the paddle which he had used in steering, he desired the whole party to look up, announcing to them that they were beneath the 'silent pine.'

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;89;a common exclamation of pleasure succeeded the upward glance, for it is seldom that a tree is seen to more advantage than that which immediately attracted every eye.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;89;the pine stood on the bank, with its roots embedded in the earth, a few feet higher than the level of the lake, but in such a situation as to bring the distance above the water into the apparent height of the tree.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;89;the tall column-like tree had inclined to wards the light when struggling among its fellows, and it now so far overhung the lake, that its summit may have been some ten or fifteen feet without the base.

bugle;Ajuga reptans;organism;PG10149;90;"this actually surpasses the celebrated echoes of the rhine," cried the delighted eve, "for, though those do give the strains of the bugle so clearly, i do not think they answer to the voice with so much fidelity."

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10149;91;"are you serious, cousin jack?"

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;95;"certainly, john, my only wish is to preserve the property for those to whom it is especially devised, to allow those who have the best, nay, the only right to it, its undisturbed possession, occasionally, and to prevent any more of that injury to the trees that has been committed by some of those rude men, who always fancy themselves so completely all the public, as to be masters, in their own particular persons, whenever the public has any claim.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10149;99;"that unequalled pecuniary prosperity should sensibly impair the manners of what is termed the world, by introducing suddenly lame bodies of uninstructed and untrained men and women into society, is a natural consequence of obvious causes, that it should corrupt morals, even, we have a right to expect, for we are taught to believe it the most corrupting influence under which men can live, but, i confess, i did not expect to see the day, when a body of strangers, birds of passage, creatures of an hour, should assume a right to call on the old and long-established inhabitants of a country, to prove their claims to their possessions, and this, too, in an unusual and unheard-of manner, under the penalty of being violently deprived of them!"

bird;Aves;organism;PG10149;99;i have had the curiosity to inquire, and have ascertained that none of the old, permanent families have been active in this affair of the point, but that all the clamour has been made by those you call the birds of passage.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;104;then the two hussies would talk of nature, 'our beautiful nature' dorindy says eve had the impudence to call it, and, as if human nature and its failings and backsliding wore not a fitter subject for a young woman's discourse, than a silly conversation about lakes, and rocks, and trees, and as if she owned the nature about templeton.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;121;as he had a secret pleasure in obeying any injunction of eve's, the young man himself sought captain truck, even before they had breakfasted, and, as he had made an acquaintance with 'the commodore,' on the lake, previously to the arrival of the effinghams, that worthy was summoned, and regularly introduced to the honest ship-master.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;121;"i have dared even to exceed your instructions, miss effingham," said paul, "for i have promised the captain to endeavour to persuade you, and as many of the ladies as possible, to trust yourselves to my seamanship, and to submit to be rowed out to the spot where we shall find him and his friend the commodore riding at anchor."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;122;their professional terms agreed as ill as possible, for when the captain used the expression 'ship the oars,' the commodore understood just the reverse of what it had been intended to express, and, once, when he told his companion to 'give way,' the latter took the hint so literally as actually to cease rowing.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;122;owing to several contre-tems of this nature, by the time they reached the fishing-ground the captain began to entertain a feeling for the commodore, that ill comported with the deference due to his titular rank.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;122;"i have come out with you, commodore," said captain truck, when they had got to their station, and laying a peculiar emphasis on the appellation he used, "in order to enjoy myself, and you will confer an especial favour on me by not using such phrases as 'cable-rope,' 'casting anchor,' and 'titivating.'

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;122;"that follows by no means, commodore, as i have some reason to know, for my father having been a parson, and i being a seaman, we may be said to have the whole subject, as it were, in the family.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;122;"pray, sir," asked the commodore, with dignity, "what are you in the practice of saying, when you speak of such matters, for, to be frank with you, we always use these terms on these lakes."

bird;Aves;organism;PG10149;122;we say 'anchor,' or 'let go the anchor,' or 'dropped the anchor,' or some such reasonable expression, and not 'cast anchor,' as if a bit of iron, weighing two or three tons, is to be jerked about like a stone big enough to kill a bird with.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;123;as for 'ropes,' i suppose you have not got to be a commodore, and need being told how many there are in a ship."

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10149;123;"i do not pretend to have counted them, but i have seen a ship, sir, and one under full sail, too, and i know there were as many ropes about her as there are pines on the vision."

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;123;"are there more than seven of these trees on your mountain?

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;123;"well, sir, every man to his trade," said the commodore, who just then pulled in a fine pickerel, which was the third he had taken, while his companion rejoiced in no more than a few fruitless bites.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;123;the little brush in which he was now engaged with the commodore, he conceived due to his own dignity, and his motive was duly to impress his companion with his superiority, which being fairly admitted, he would have been ready enough to acknowledge that the other understood pike-fishing much better than himself.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;123;but it was quite too early in the discussion to make any such avowal, and the supercilious remark of the commodore's putting him on his mettle, he was ready to affirm that he had eaten 'sogdollagers' for breakfast, a month at a time, had it been necessary.

fluke;Trematoda;organism;PG10149;123;if you were to see a whale's flukes thrashing your puddle, every cruiser among you would run for a port, and as for 'sogdollagers,' we think little of them in salt-water, the flying-fish, or even the dry dolphin, being much the best eating."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;123;"sir," said the commodore, with some heat, and a great deal of emphasis, "there is but one 'sogdollager' in the world, and he is in this lake.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;123;"sir," repeated the commodore, flourishing his hand, and waxing warm with earnestness, "there is but one 'sogdollager' in the universe, and that is in lake otsego.

salmon;Oncorhynchus;organism;PG10149;123;a 'sogdollager' is a salmon trout, and not a species, a sort of father to all the salmon trout in this part of the world, a scaly patriarch."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;124;this allusion happily preserved the peace, for, if there were any thing in the world for which the commodore entertained a profound, but obscure reverence, it was for a whale.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10149;124;he even thought better of a man for having actually seen one, gambolling in the freedom of the ocean, and his mind became suddenly oppressed by the glory of a mariner, who had passed his life among such gigantic animals.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;124;repeated the commodore, who began to entertain an awe of his companion, that he never expected to feel for any human being on lake otsego, "are you certain, sir, there is no mistake in this?"

insect;Insecta;organism;PG10149;124;"none in the least, not only islands, but whole archipelagos are made annually, by the sea insects in that quarter of the world, but, then, you are not to form your notions of an insect in such an ocean, by the insects you see in such a bit of water as this."

salmon;Oncorhynchus;organism;PG10149;124;"as big as our pickerel, or salmon trout, i dare say?"

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;124;returned the commodore, in the simplicity of his heart, for by this time his local and exclusive conceit was thoroughly humbled, and he was almost ready to believe any thing.

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10149;124;a solitary shark, i dare say, would set your whole lake in commotion?"

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10149;124;"i think we might manage a shark, sir.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG10149;124;i once saw one of those animals, and i do really believe the sogdollager would outweigh him.

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10149;124;i do think we might manage a shark, sir."

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10149;124;but what would you say to a shark as long as one of those pines on the mountain?"

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10149;124;but what would you say to a shark as long as one of those pines on the mountain?"

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10149;124;he would take in a platoon, indian file i dare say one of those pines, now, may be thirty or forty feet high!"

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;124;that there should be a tree, so far inland, that was larger than his main-yard, he did not think probable, although that yard itself was made of part of a tree, and, in the laudable intention of duly impressing his companion with the superiority of a real seaman over a mere freshwater navigator, he had inadvertently laid bare a weak spot in his estimate of heights and distances, that the commodore seized upon, with some such avidity as the pike seizes the hook.

freshwater;Corbicula;organism;PG10149;124;that there should be a tree, so far inland, that was larger than his main-yard, he did not think probable, although that yard itself was made of part of a tree, and, in the laudable intention of duly impressing his companion with the superiority of a real seaman over a mere freshwater navigator, he had inadvertently laid bare a weak spot in his estimate of heights and distances, that the commodore seized upon, with some such avidity as the pike seizes the hook.

dog;Canis lupus familiaris;organism;PG10149;124;this accidental mistake alone saved the latter from an abject submission, for the cool superiority of the captain had so far deprived him of his conceit, that he was almost ready to acknowledge himself no better than a dog, when he caught a glimpse of light through this opening.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;124;"the sea may have its big monsters, captain, but our hills have their big trees.

shark;Selachimorpha;organism;PG10149;125;did you ever see a shark of half that length?"

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;125;this general discussion completely restored amity between the parties, for, to confess the truth, our old friend the captain was a little rebuked about the affair of the tree.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;125;the only peculiarity worthy of notice, that occurred in the course of their various digressions, was the fact, that the commodore insensibly began to style his companion "general," the courtesy of the country in his eyes, appearing to require that a man who has seen so much more than himself, should, at least, enjoy a title equal to his own in rank, and that of admiral being proscribed by the sensitiveness of republican principles.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10149;125;"as we are here by ourselves under these venerable oaks, and talking like two old messmates," returned the general, "i shall just own the truth, and make no bones of it.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;125;it is a vice that i deprecate, and, whatever may be the laws of this country, i am of opinion, that equality is no where borne out by the law of nations, which, after all, commodore, is the only true law for a gentleman to live under."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;125;would you believe, commodore, that there are countries, in which they lay taxes on tobacco?"

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10149;125;here the commodore raised a large silver punch-bowl, which pierre had furnished, to his lips, and fastening his eyes on the boughs of a knarled oak, he looked like a man who was taking an observation, for near a minute.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;125;repeated the commodore, drawing a long breath, as if he was just recovering the play of his lungs, "i should as soon think of laying a tax on punch.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;126;"i find you are a sensible man, commodore, and regret i did not make your acquaintance earlier in life.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;126;"certain," said the commodore, "it is at the foot of the lake."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;126;"my dear commodore, when we say 'the river,' we always mean the connecticut, and i am surprised a man of your sagacity should require to be told this.

hickory;Carya;organism;PG10149;126;pray, my good friend, what are your real sentiments concerning 'old hickory.'

gull;Larus;organism;PG10149;126;this time, he took aim at a gull that was sailing over his head, only relinquishing the draught as the bird settled into the water.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10149;126;the 'general' was more particular, for selecting a stationary object, in the top of an oak, that grew on the mountain near him, he studied it with an admirable abstruseness of attention, until the last drop was drained.

lemon;Citrus × limon;organism;PG10149;126;as soon as this startling fact was mentioned, however, both the convives set about repairing the accident, by squeezing lemons, sweetening water, and mixing liquors, secundem artem.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;126;"we have been so frank with each other to-day, my excellent commodore," said captain truck, "that did i know your true sentiments concerning temperance societies, i should look on your inmost soul as a part of myself.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;"if liquors were not made to be drunk," put in the commodore, logically, "i would again ask for what are they made?

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;"commodore, i wish you twenty more good hearty years of fishing in this lake, which grows, each instant, more beautiful in my eyes, as i confess does the whole earth, and to show you that i say no more than i think, i will clench it with a draught."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;captain truck now brought his right eye to bear on the new moon, which happened to be at a convenient height, closed the left one, and continued in that attitude until the commodore began seriously to think he was to get nothing besides, the lemon-seeds for his share.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;the commodore now had his turn, and before he got through, the bottom of the vessel was as much uppermost as the butt of a club bed firelock.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG10149;127;when the honest fisherman took breath after this exploit, and lowered his cup from the vault of heaven to the surface of the earth, he caught a view of a boat crossing the lake, coming from the silent pine, to that point on which they were enjoying so many agreeable hallucinations on the subject of temperance.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;"under ordinary circumstances, commodore, i should prefer your society to all the petticoats in the state, but there are two ladies in that party, either of whom i would marry, any day, at a minute's warning."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;"sir," said the commodore with a tone of warning, "we, who have lived bachelors so long, and are wedded to the water, ought never to speak lightly on so grave a subject."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;by this time both the salt-water and the fresh-water sailor were in that condition when men are apt to think aloud, and the commodore had lost all his awe of his companion.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;"this is a new character of them, commodore, as they generally pass for the best, in their own eyes.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;127;now, sir, i have a feeling for every pebble on the shore of this lake, a sympathy with every wave,"--here the commodore began to twirl his hand about, with the fingers standing apart, like so many spikes in a che-vaux-de-frise --"and each hour, as i row across it, i find i like it better, and yet, sir, would you believe me, i often go away of a morning to pass the day on the water, and, on returning home at night, find half the houses filled with new faces."

herring;Herklotsichthys;organism;PG10149;128;"exactly so, sir, just as it used to be with the herrings in the otsego, before the.

swallow;Hirundinidae;organism;PG10149;128;susquehannah was dammed, and is still, with the swallows."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;128;depend on it, sir," added the commodore, in the simplicity of his heart, "heaven is no place for a yankee, if he can get farther west, by hook or by crook.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;128;"that can hardly be, commodore, since the points of the compass only refer to objects on this earth.

gudgeon;Gobio gobio;organism;PG10149;128;"not enough, sir, to catch the merest fresh-water gudgeon that swims.

gudgeon;Squalidus;organism;PG10149;128;"not enough, sir, to catch the merest fresh-water gudgeon that swims.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;128;now, commodore, hand me the bowl, and we will get it ready down to the shore, and offer the ladies our homage.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;128;and so you have become a laker in your religion, my dear commodore," continued the general, between his teeth, while he smoked and squeezed a lemon at the same time, "and do your worshipping on the water?"

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;128;"was he glad to see you, commodore?"

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;128;"you told him, of course, commodore?"

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10149;128;says the devil, calling out to one of his imps, 'boy, run and catch my horse--i must be off, and have a finger in that pie.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;128;what denominations have you in that quarter, commodore?

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10149;129;'stop,' said the devil, 'that's enough, you imp, be nimble with that horse.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;129;let me see, commodore, what, part of the country did you say you came from?'

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG10149;129;"he called out to the imp, again--'hollo, you boy, never mind that horse, these people will all be here before i can get there.'"

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;129;here the commodore and the general began to laugh, until the arches of the forest rang with their merriment.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;129;the usual effect of punch is to cause people to see double, but, on this occasion, the mistake was the other way, for two boats had touched the strand, instead of the one announced by the commodore, and they brought with them the whole party from the wigwam, steadfast and aristabalus included.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10149;129;the party soon separated into groups, or pairs, some being seated on the margin of the limpid water, enjoying the light cool airs, by which it was fanned, others lay off in the boats fishing, while the remainder plunged into the woods, that, in their native wildness, bounded the little spot of verdure, which, canopied by old oaks, formed the arena so lately in controversy.

grass;Agrostis capillaris;organism;PG10149;129;the repast was laid on the grass, notwithstanding aristabulus more than hinted that the public, his beloved public, usually saw fit to introduce rude tables for that purpose.

bird;Aves;organism;PG10149;129;the messrs. effinghams, however, were not to be taught by a mere bird of passage, how a rustic fęte so peculiarly their own, ought to be conducted, and the attendants were directed to spread the dishes on the turf.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10149;129;of all there assembled, the parisian feelings of mademoiselle viefville were the most excited, for to her, the scene was one of pure delights, with the noble panorama of forest-clad mountains, the mirror-like lake, the overshadowing oaks, and the tangled brakes of the adjoining woods.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG10149;130;the whole party arose, and separating naturally, they strolled in groups or pairs again, along the pebbly strand, or beneath the trees, while the attendants made the preparations to depart.

parrot;Psittaciformes;organism;PG10149;131;"yes," said grace, bitterly, "i speak them, as the parrot repeats words that he does not understand.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;132;she had left the circle, attended by paul, her father, and aristabulus, but no sooner had they reached the margin of the water, than the two former were called away by captain truck, to settle some controverted point between the latter and the commodore.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10149;132;"i should like to know if it be really true that no woman was ever unsuccessfully wooed beneath these oaks?

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10149;132;let me, then, seize this happy moment, here, beneath the hymeneal oaks, to offer you this faithful hand and this willing heart.

bush;Viburnum plicatum;organism;PG10149;133;by way of rendering the scene perfect, aristabulus had taken out his penknife, cut a twig from a bush, and he now rendered himself doubly interesting by commencing the favourite occupation of whittling.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;133;mr. dodge swallowed his discontent, and the whole party soon embarked, to return to the village, the commodore and general taking a boat by themselves, in order to bring their discussions on human affairs in general, to a suitable close.

robin;Erithacus;organism;PG10149;137;in a word, clamour was the one thing needful, and as regards time, that great regulator of all harmonies, paul powis whispered to the captain that the air they had just been listening to, resembled what the sailors call a 'round robin,' or a particular mode of signing complaints practised by seamen, in which the nicest observer cannot tell which is the beginning, or which the end.

horse-chestnut;Aesculus hippocastanum;organism;PG10149;137;there were the usual allusions to greece and rome, between the republics of which and that of this country there exists some such affinity as is to be found between a horse-chestnut and a chestnut-horse, or that, of mere words,and a long catalogue of national glories that might very well have sufficed for all the republics, both of antiquity and of our own time.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10149;174;"nay, he may some day unexpectedly become my father too, as he has so wonderfully become yours," rejoined eve, glancing archly at the glowing face of the delighted young man, "and then cousin jack might prove too familiar and disrespectful a term."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;183;"re-what, ma'am," said the commodore, who was not conscious of ever having heard the word before, for, in his sabbaths on the water, where he often worshipped god devoutly in his heart, the language of the professedly pious was never heard, "i can only say she is as pretty a skiff as floats, but i can tell you nothing about resuscitation--indeed, i never heard of her having been drowned."

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;184;while the commodore was holding mrs. abbott at bay, in this manner, captain truck, who had given him a wink to that effect, was employed in playing off a practical joke at the expense of the widow.

jack;Esox lucius;organism;PG10149;184;abbott was altogether engaged in expecting the terrible announcement of her daughter's errors, the captain slipped them, kings, queens and knaves, high, low, jack and the game, without regard to rank, into the lady's work-basket.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;184;as soon as this feat was successfully performed, a sign was given to the commodore that the conspiracy was effected, and that disputant in theology gradually began to give ground, while he continued to maintain that jumping the rope was a sin, though it might be one of a nominal class.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;185;it was perhaps lucky for the commodore, who was capital at casting a pickerel line, but who usually settled his polemics with the fist, when hard pushed, that captain truck found leisure to come to the rescue.

commodore;Junonia;organism;PG10149;185;when the two worthies were at a reasonable distance from the shore, the commodore suddenly ceased rowing, made a flourish with his hand, and incontinently began to laugh, as if his mirth had suddenly broken through all restraint.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10150;9;when he had finished his supper, and lifted the tray to the other end of the great oak dining-table, he got out his books again, put fresh wood on the fire, trimmed his lamp, and set himself down to a spell of real hard work.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;9;then it was that he began to notice for the first time what a noise the rats were making.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;9;it was evident that at first the rats had been frightened at the presence of a stranger, and the light of fire and lamp, but that as the time went on they had grown bolder and were now disporting themselves as was their wont.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10150;10;the carving of the oak on the panels of the wainscot was fine, and on and round the doors and windows it was beautiful and of rare merit.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;10;here and there as he went round he saw some crack or hole blocked for a moment by the face of a rat with its bright eyes glittering in the light, but in an instant it was gone, and a squeak and a scamper followed.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10150;10;he pulled up close to the hearth a great high-backed carved oak chair, and sat down to his last cup of tea.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;10;for a little while the rats disturbed him somewhat with their perpetual scampering, but he got accustomed to the noise as one does to the ticking of a clock or to the roar of moving water, and he became so immersed in his work that everything in the world, except the problem which he was trying to solve, passed away from him.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;10;before, however, he could strike it, the rat, with a squeak that sounded like the concentration of hate, jumped upon the floor, and, running up the rope of the alarm bell, disappeared in the darkness beyond the range of the green-shaded lamp.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;10;instantly, strange to say, the noisy scampering of the rats in the wainscot began again.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;11;the book was badly aimed and the rat did not stir, so again the poker performance of the previous night was repeated, and again the rat, being closely pursued, fled up the rope of the alarm bell.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;11;strangely too, the departure of this rat was instantly followed by the renewal of the noise made by the general rat community.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;11;on this occasion, as on the previous one, malcolmson could not see at what part of the room the rat disappeared, for the green shade of his lamp left the upper part of the room in darkness, and the fire had burned low.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10150;11;he had got through a good spell of work, and thought himself entitled to a cigarette, and so he sat on the great oak chair before the fire and enjoyed it.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;12;whilst smoking he began to think that he would like to know where the rat disappeared to, for he had certain ideas for the morrow not entirely disconnected with a rat-trap.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;12;he began his work again, and though as before somewhat disturbed at first by the noise of the rats, soon lost himself in his propositions and problems.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;12;he raised a book in his right hand, and taking careful aim, flung it at the rat.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;12;he then took another book, and a third, and flung them one after another at the rat, but each time unsuccessfully.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;12;at last, as he stood with a book poised in his hand to throw, the rat squeaked and seemed afraid.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;12;this made malcolmson more than ever eager to strike, and the book flew and struck the rat a resounding blow.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;12;malcolmson kept his eyes on the rat, and saw it by the light of the second lamp leap to a moulding of the wainscot and disappear through a hole in one of the great pictures which hung on the wall, obscured and invisible through its coating of dirt and dust.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;12;he sat down to work again, and the rats in the wainscot renewed their gambols.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;13;thornhill listened with a face of growing gravity, and when the narrative was complete and mrs. witham had been restored he asked,'the rat always went up the rope of the alarm bell?'

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;13;it may be that he is in a highly overwrought state, and has been studying too much, although i am bound to say that he seems as sound and healthy a young man, mentally and bodily, as ever i saw--but then the rats--and that suggestion of the devil.'

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;14;for a few minutes after his entrance the noise of the rats ceased, but so soon as they became accustomed to his presence they began again.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;14;he was glad to hear them, for he felt once more the feeling of companionship in their noise, and his mind ran back to the strange fact that they only ceased to manifest themselves when that other--the great rat with the baleful eyes--came upon the scene.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10150;14;even the great alarm bell on the roof must have felt the force of the wind, for the rope rose and fell slightly, as though the bell were moved a little from time to time and the limber rope fell on the oak floor with a hard and hollow sound.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;14;looking up instinctively malcolmson saw the great rat coming slowly down towards him, glaring at him steadily.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;14;he dropped the rope and started back with a muttered curse, and the rat turning ran up the rope again and disappeared, and at the same instant malcolmson became conscious that the noise of the rats, which had ceased for a while, began again.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;14;all this set him thinking, and it occurred to him that he had not investigated the lair of the rat or looked at the pictures, as he had intended.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;14;he lit the other lamp without the shade, and, holding it up went and stood opposite the third picture from the fireplace on the right-hand side where he had seen the rat disappear on the previous night.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;14;as he looked at them, malcolmson grew cold, for he saw there the very counterpart of the eyes of the great rat.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;14;the lamp almost fell from his hand, he saw the rat with its baleful eyes peering out through the hole in the corner of the picture, and noted the sudden cessation of the noise of the other rats.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10150;14;the judge was seated in a great high-backed carved oak chair, on the right-hand side of a great stone fireplace where, in the corner, a rope hung down from the ceiling, its end lying coiled on the floor.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;15;there, in the judge's arm-chair, with the rope hanging behind, sat the rat with the judge's baleful eyes, now intensified and with a fiendish leer.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;15;looking up, however, he saw in the dim light the great rat clinging to the rope and gnawing it.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;15;as he looked the job was completed, and the severed end of the rope fell clattering on the oaken floor, whilst for an instant the great rat remained like a knob or tassel at the end of the rope, which now began to sway to and fro.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;15;malcolmson felt for a moment another pang of terror as he thought that now the possibility of calling the outer world to his assistance was cut off, but an intense anger took its place, and seizing the book he was reading he hurled it at the rat.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;15;the blow was well aimed, but before the missile could reach him the rat dropped off and struck the floor with a soft thud.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;15;malcolmson felt that his work was over for the night, and determined then and there to vary the monotony of the proceedings by a hunt for the rat, and took off the green shade of the lamp so as to insure a wider spreading light.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;16;at the many rat-holes and in the chinks and crannies of the wainscot he saw the rats' eyes, and this aspect, that was purely physical, gave him a gleam of comfort.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;16;he looked around and saw that the rope of the great alarm bell was laden with rats.

rat;Rattus;organism;PG10150;16;a dreadful peal of thunder broke overhead as he raised the rope again, whilst the rats kept running up and down the rope as though working against time.

oak;Quercus;organism;PG10150;16;then the judge, taking the rigid form of the student in his arms, carried him over and placed him standing in the oak chair, and stepping up beside him, put his hand up and caught the end of the swaying rope of the alarm bell.

cat;Felis;organism;PG10150;18;the black cat cast a swift upward glance, and we saw her eyes like green fire fixed an instant on elias p. hutcheson, and then her attention was given to the kitten, which lay still with just a quiver of her tiny limbs, whilst a thin red stream trickled from a gaping wound.

cat;Felis;organism;PG10150;19;as he spoke he looked over the wall, but the cat on seeing him, retreated, with a growl, into a bed of tall flowers, and was hidden.

cat;Felis;organism;PG10150;19;amelia did not like to say more, lest he might, in mistaken kindness to her, fulfil his threat of shooting the cat,and so we went on and crossed the little wooden bridge leading to the gateway whence ran the steep paved roadway between the burg and the pentagonal torture tower.

antelope;Alcelaphinae;organism;PG1015;23;we wrapped ourselves in our blankets, and sat down by the fire, and delorier, combining his culinary functions with his duties as sentinel, employed himself in boiling the head of an antelope for our morning's repast.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG1015;34;suddenly the ridges of the hills were alive with a swarm of mounted indians, at least six hundred in number, who, with a tremendous yell, came pouring down toward the camp, rushing up within a few rods, to the great terror of the emigrants, but suddenly wheeling, they swept around the band of horses, and in five minutes had disappeared with their prey through the openings of the hills.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG1015;41;opposite to us rose the blockhouse above the gateway, it was adorned with a figure which even now haunts my memory, a horse at full speed, daubed upon the boards with red paint, and exhibiting a degree of skill which might rival that displayed by the indians in executing similar designs upon their robes and lodges.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG1015;105;when we came near them, we stopped where a gentle swell of the plain concealed us from their view, and while i held his horse reynal ran forward with his rifle, till i lost sight of him beyond the rising ground.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG1015;105;a few minutes elapsed, i heard the report of his piece, and saw the buffalo running away at full speed on the right, and immediately after, the hunter himself unsuccessful as before, came up and mounted his horse in excessive ill-humor.

deer;Cervidae;organism;PG1015;105;he cursed the black hills and the buffalo, swore that he was a good hunter, which indeed was true, and that he had never been out before among those mountains without killing two or three deer at least.

antelope;Alcelaphinae;organism;PG1015;105;as we rode along, antelope in considerable numbers were flying lightly in all directions over the plain, but not one of them would stand and be shot at.

animal;Animalia;organism;PG1015;105;when we reached the foot of the mountain ridge that lay between us and the village, we were too impatient to take the smooth and circuitous route, so turning short to the left, we drove our wearied animals directly upward among the rocks.

rabbit;Lagomorpha;organism;PG1015;105;here we saw his young indian relative, the hail-storm, his light graceful figure on the ground in an easy attitude, while with his friend the rabbit, who sat by his side, he was making an abundant meal from a wooden bowl of wasna, which the squaw had placed between them.

whites;Pieris (Pieridae);organism;PG1015;106;most of the indians in the village, it is true, professed good-will toward the whites, but the experience of others and my own observation had taught me the extreme folly of confidence, and the utter impossibility of foreseeing to what sudden acts the strange unbridled impulses of an indian may urge him.

tree;Tracheophyta;organism;PG1015;107;as i had approached noiselessly with my moccasined feet, the old man was quite unconscious of my presence, and turning to a point where i could gain an unobstructed view of him, i saw him seated alone, immovable as a statue, among the rocks and trees.

pine;Pinus;organism;PG1015;107;an hour and a half of slow and often intermittent labor brought me to the very summit, and emerging from the dark shadows of the rocks and pines, i stepped forth into the light, and walking along the sunny verge of a precipice, seated myself on its extreme point.

and relative;Vespertilioninae;organism;PG1015;108;i was not a little astonished when i came to the camp, at the confusion of horrible sounds with which it was filled, howls, shrieks, and wailings were heard from all the women present, many of whom not content with this exhibition of grief for the loss of their friends and relatives, were gashing their legs deeply with knives.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG1015;108;the warrior in question led his two best horses into the center of the village, and gave them away to his friends, upon which songs and acclamations in praise of his generosity mingled with the cries of the women.

mule;Equus mulus;organism;PG1015;108;raymond was an excellent rider, and at first he stuck fast in his seat, but the moment after, i saw the mule's hind-legs flourishing in the air, and my unlucky follower pitching head foremost over her ears.

elk;Alces alces;organism;PG1015;108;he was pointing toward a detached rocky hill that stood in the middle of the valley before us, and from behind it a long file of elk came out at full speed and entered an opening in the side of the mountain.

sheep;Ovis aries;organism;PG1015;108;i ran up to the top of the opening, which gave me a full view into the rocky gorge beyond, and here i plainly saw some fifty or sixty sheep, almost within rifle-shot, clattering upward among the rocks, and endeavoring, after their usual custom, to reach the highest point.

horse;Equus ferus caballus;organism;PG1015;109;as he suffered his ornamented buffalo robe to fall into folds about his loins, his stately and graceful figure was fully displayed, and while he sat his horse in an easy attitude, the long feathers of the prairie cock fluttering from the crown of his head, he seemed the very model of a wild prairie-rider.

beast;Animalia;organism;PG1015;109;nay, so alien to himself do they appear that, having breathed for a few months or a few weeks the air of this region, he begins to look upon them as a troublesome and dangerous species of wild beast, and, if expedient, he could shoot them with as little compunction as they themselves would experience after performing the same office upon him.
